Computers and connected systems are central to modern life, but they also expose
substantial security risks. The [Secure Systems Laboratory (SSL)](/overview/) at
New York University addresses these challenges by designing practical,
open-source solutions that improve the security of real-world systems at scale.
The lab is directed by Professor [Justin
Cappos](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/justin-cappos), whose research
focuses on resilient software infrastructure, virtualization technologies,
software engineering debugging tools, and software supply chain integrity.

Key lab technologies include the secure software update framework [The Update
Framework (TUF)](/projects/#the-update-framework-tuf) and
[in-toto](/projects/#in-toto), the de facto standard for software supply chain
attestations, both of which are graduated projects of the [Cloud Native
Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/). It also includes the widely
used [Uptane](/projects/#uptane) standard which is used both for securing
automotive software updates and on millions of other devices; and
[gittuf](/projects/#gittuf), which improves the security of Git repositories.
These and other projects developed at SSL are used across container ecosystems,
open-source projects, embedded systems, and enterprise environments on millions
of computers worldwide.

At SSL, we believe security research should have real-world impact. SSL projects
are developed in collaboration with foundations and standards bodies such as the
[JDF](https://jointdevelopment.org/), CNCF, and the [Open Source Security
Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/), helping ensure that research
results translate into widely adopted, interoperable solutions. Learn more about
collaborating [here](/collaborate/).
