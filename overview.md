Computers and connected systems are central to modern life, but they also 
expose substantial security risks. The 
[Secure Systems Laboratory (SSL)](/overview/) at New York University addresses 
these challenges by designing practical, open-source solutions that improve 
the security of real-world systems at scale. The lab is directed by Professor 
[Justin Cappos](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/justin-cappos), whose 
research focuses on resilient software infrastructure, virtualization 
technologies, software engineering debugging tools, and software supply 
chain integrity.

SSL’s research spans multiple areas of systems security — including software 
update frameworks, software supply chain attestation, secure version control, 
virtualization, bug finding in software, IoT update security, and more — with 
an emphasis on tools that are both rigorously designed and deployed in 
production environments.

Key lab technologies include the secure software update framework
[The Update Framework (TUF)](/projects/#the-update-framework-tuf) and
[in-toto](/projects/#in-toto) the de facto standard for software supply chain 
attestations, both of which are graduated projects of the 
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).  It also
includes the widely used [Uptane](/projects/#uptane) standard which is used
both for securing automotive software updates and on millions of other devices;
and [gittuf](/projects/#gittuf), which improves the security of Git 
repositories. These and other projects developed at SSL are used across 
container ecosystems, open-source projects, embedded systems, and enterprise 
environments on millions of computers worldwide.

Our work is closely aligned with the broader open-source security ecosystem. 
Several SSL projects are developed in collaboration with foundations and 
standards bodies such as the [JDF](https://jointdevelopment.org/), CNCF, and 
the [Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)](https://openssf.org/), helping 
ensure that research results translate into widely adopted, interoperable 
solutions.

At SSL, we believe security research should have real-world impact. All of 
our software is released as open source, and we actively collaborate with 
industry partners, academic researchers, and open-source communities. Learn 
more about collaborating with the lab on the [Collaborate](/collaborate/) page.
