    abstract: "Web-based Git hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab are popular
choices to manage and interact with Git repositories. However, they lack
an important security feature—the ability to sign Git commits. Users
instruct the server to perform repository operations on their behalf and
have to trust that the server will execute their requests faithfully.
Such trust may be unwarranted though because a malicious or a
compromised server may execute the requested actions in an incorrect
manner, leading to a different state of the repository than what the
user intended.

In this paper, we show a range of high-impact attacks that can be
executed stealthily when developers use the web UI of a Git hosting
service to perform common actions such as editing files or merging
branches. We then propose le-git-imate, a defense against these attacks
which provides security guarantees comparable and compatible with Git's
standard commit signing mechanism. We implement le-git-imate as a Chrome
browser extension.  le-git-imate
does not require changes on the server side and can thus be used
immediately. It also preserves current workflows used in Github/GitLab
and does not require the user to leave the browser, and it allows anyone
to verify that the server's actions faithfully follow the user's
requested actions.  Moreover, experimental evaluation using the browser
extension shows that le-git-imate has comparable performance with Git's
standard commit signature mechanism.  With our solution in place, users
can take advantage of GitHub/GitLab's web-based features without
sacrificing security, thus paving the way towards verifiable web-based
Git repositories."

    abstract: "Prior work has shown that extremely small code patterns, such as
    the conditional operator and implicit type conversion, can cause
    considerable misunderstanding in programmers. Until now, the real world
    impact of these patterns - known as 'atoms of confusion' - was only
    speculative. This work uses a corpus of 14 of the most popular and
    influential open source C and C++ projects to measure the prevalence and
    significance of these small confusing patterns. Our results show that the 15
    known types of confusing micro patterns occur millions of times in programs
    like the Linux kernel and GCC, appearing on average once every 23 lines. We
    show there is a strong correlation between these confusing patterns and
    bug-fix commits, as well as a tendency for confusing patterns to be
    commented. We also explore patterns at the project level showing the rate of
    security vulnerabilities is higher in projects with more atoms. Finally,
    we examine real code examples containing these atoms, including ones that
    were used to find and fix bugs in our corpus. In total, this work demonstrates
    that beyond simple misunderstanding in the lab setting, atoms of confusion
    are both prevalent - occurring often in real projects, and meaningful -
    being removed by bug-fix commits at an elevated rate."

    abstract: "Program comprehension is a common task in
software development. Programmers perform program
comprehension at different stages of the software development
life cycle. Detecting when a programmer experiences problems or
confusion can be difficult. Self-reported data may be useful, but
not reliable. More importantly, it is hard to use the self-reported
feedback in real time.
In this study, we use an inexpensive, non-invasive EEG device
to record 8 subjects’ brain activity in short program
comprehension. Subjects were presented either confusing or nonconfusing
C/C++ code snippets. Paired sample t-tests are used to
compare the average magnitude in alpha and theta frequency
bands. The results show that the differences in the average
magnitude in both bands are significant comparing confusing
and non-confusing questions. We then use ANOVA to detect
whether such difference also presented in the same type of
questions. We found that there is no significant difference across
questions of the same difficulty level. Our outcome, however,
shows alpha and theta band powers both increased when subjects
are under the heavy cognitive workload. Other research studies
reported a negative correlation between (upper) alpha and theta

order to perform semi-controlled experiments with this platform. Any smartphone
user can install Sensibility Testbed and develop a simple sensor application in
less than a day. One of the problems with developing and testing such a
framework is that there are many possible hardware platforms and system
configurations. Hackathons provide an effective venue for observing the
development of applications on a range of devices by users with no previous
knowledge of the framework.

In this paper, we describe our experiences with hosting hackathons in a variety
of venues, including the challenges of working in unfamiliar environments and
with researchers who had no prior knowledge of the testbed. The feedback from
participants has been very useful in identifying usability issues, hardware
issues, and the types of sensor applications that users want to create."

    abstract: "Due to their omnipresence, mobile devices such as smartphones
could be tremendously valuable to researchers. However, since research
projects can extract data about device owners that could
be personal or sensitive, there are substantial privacy concerns.
Currently, the only regulation to protect user privacy for research
projects is through Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) from researchers’
institutions. However, there is no guarantee that researchers
will follow the IRB protocol. Even worse, researchers
without security expertise might build apps that are vulnerable to
attacks.
In this work, we present a platform, Sensibility Testbed, for
automated enforcement of the privacy policies set by IRBs. Our
platform enforces such policies when a researcher runs code on
mobile devices. The enforcement mechanism is a set of obfuscation
layers in a secure sandbox, that can be customized for any level
of IRB compliance, and can be augmented by policies set by the
device owner."

    abstract: "A widely accepted premise is that complex software frequently
    contains bugs that can be remotely exploited by attackers. When this
    software is on an electronic control unit (ECU) in a vehicle,
exploitation of these bugs can have life or death
consequences. Since software for vehicles is likely to
proliferate and grow more complex in time, the number
of exploitable vulnerabilities will increase. As a result,
manufacturers are keenly aware of the need to quickly
and efficiently deploy updates so that software vulnerabilities
can be remedied as soon as possible.
However, existing software-update security systems
are not compromise resilient; if an attacker breaks into
any portion of an automobile’s infrastructure, they could
compromise numerous vehicles. The industry needs to
dynamically choose updates for vehicles based on fresh
information, forcing manufacturers to choose existing
systems that sign updates using a key stored on the
server. Attackers who compromise the repository can abuse this online key and cause malicious software to be
installed on vehicles.
In this article we discuss Uptane, the first, to our
knowledge, compromise-resilient software update security
system designed specifically for vehicles. It is
designed to make obtaining all the pieces required to
control a vehicle extremely difficult for attackers."

for updating software on automobiles that follows the open door strategy.
It was jointly developed with the University of Michigan Transportation
Research Institute (UMTRI), and the Southwest Research Institute (SWRI),

    abstract: "Humans often mistake the meaning of source code, and so misjudge
a programs true behavior. These mistakes can be caused
by extremely small, isolated patterns in code, which can lead to
significant runtime errors. These patterns are used in large, popular
software projects and even recommended in style guides. To
identify code patterns that may confuse programmers we extracted
a preliminary set of 'atoms of confusion' from known confusing
code. We show empirically in an experiment with 73 participants
that these code patterns can lead to a significantly increased rate of
misunderstanding versus equivalent code without the patterns. We
then go on to take larger confusing programs and measure (in an
experiment with 43 participants) the impact, in terms of programmer
confusion, of removing these confusing patterns. All of our
instruments, analysis code, and data are publicly available online
for replication, experimentation, and feedback."

    abstract: "A popular community repository such as Docker Hub, PyPI,
    or RubyGems distributes tens of thousands of soft- ware projects to
    millions of users. The large number of projects and users make these
    repositories attractive targets for exploitation. After a repository
    compromise, a malicious party can launch a number of attacks on
    unsuspecting users, including rollback attacks that revert projects to
    obsolete and vulnerable versions. Unfortunately, due to the rapid rate
    at which packages are updated, existing techniques that protect against
    rollback attacks would cause each user to download 2–3 times the size of an
    average package in metadata each month, making them impractical to deploy.

    In this work, we develop a system called Mercury that uses a novel technique
    to compactly disseminate version information while still protecting against
    rollback attacks. Due to a different technique for dealing with key
    revocation, users are protected from rollback attacks, even if the software
    repository is compromised. This technique is bandwidth-efficient,
    especially when delta compression is used to transmit only the
    differences between previous and current lists of version information.
    An analysis we performed for the Python community shows that once Mercury
    is deployed on PyPI, each user will only download metadata each month
    that is about 3.5% the size of an average package. Our work has been
    incorporated into the latest versions of TUF, which is being integrated by
    Haskell, OCaml, RubyGems, Python, and CoreOS, and is being used in
    production by LEAP, Flynn, and Docker."

possible to trigger zero-day flaws in the host Operating

this paper, we propose a new security metric showing
strong correlation between “popular paths” and kernel
vulnerabilities. We verify that the OS kernel paths accessed
by popular applications in everyday use contain
significantly fewer security bugs than less-used paths.
We then demonstrate that this observation is useful in
practice by building a prototype system which locks an
application into using only popular OS kernel paths. By
doing so, we demonstrate that we can prevent the triggering
of zero-day kernel bugs significantly better than
three other competing approaches, and argue that this is
a practical approach to secure system design."

    abstract: "Data collected by fitness trackers could play an important
role in improving the health and well-being of the individuals who wear
them. Many insurance companies even offer monetary rewards to participants
who meet certain steps or calorie goals. However, in order for it to be
useful, the collected data must be accurate and also reflect real-world
performance. While previous studies have compared step counts data in
controlled laboratory environments for limited periods of time, few studies
have been done to measure performance over longer periods of time, while
the subject does real-world activities. There are also few direct
comparisons of a range of health indicators on different fitness tracking
devices. In this study, we compared step counts, calories burned, and miles
travelled data collected by three pairs of fitness trackers over a 14-day
time period in free-living conditions. Our work indicates that the number
of steps reported by different devices worn simultaneously could vary as
much as 26%. At the same time, the variations seen in distance travelled,
based on the step count, followed the same trends. Little correlation was
found between the number of calories burned and the variations seen in the
step count across multiple devices. Our results demonstrate that the
reporting of health indicators, such as calories burned and miles
travelled, are heavily dependent on the device itself, as well as the
manufacturer’s proprietary algorithm to calculate or infer such data. As a
result, it is difficult to use such measurements as an accurate predictor
of health outcomes, or to develop a consistent criteria to rate the
performance of such devices in head-to-head comparisons."

    abstract: "Software update systems for automobiles can deliver significant
benefits, but, if not implemented carefully, they could potentially
incur serious security vulnerabilities. Previous solutions for securing
software updates consider standard attacks and deploy widely
understood security mechanisms, such as digital signatures for the
software updates, and hardware security modules (HSM) to sign
software updates. However, no existing solution considers more
advanced security objectives, such as resilience against a repository
compromise, or freeze attacks to the vehicle's update mechanism,
or a compromise at a supplier's site. Solutions developed
for the PC world do not generalize to automobiles for two reasons:
first, they do not solve problems that are unique to the automotive
industry (e.g., that there are many different types of computers
to be updated on a vehicle), and second, they do not address
security attacks that can cause a vehicle to fail (e.g. a man-in-the-middle
attack without compromising any signing key) or that can
cause a vehicle to become unsafe. In this paper, we present Uptane,
the first software update framework for automobiles that counters
a comprehensive array of security attacks, and is resilient to partial
compromises. Uptane adds strategic features to the state-of-the-art

    abstract: "Metadata manipulation attacks represent a new threat
class directed against Version Control Systems, such as
the popular Git. This type of attack provides inconsistent
views of a repository state to different developers,
and deceives them into performing unintended operations
with often negative consequences. These include
omitting security patches, merging untested code into a
production branch, and even inadvertently installing software
containing known vulnerabilities. To make matters
worse, the attacks are subtle by nature and leave no trace
after being executed.
We propose a defense scheme that mitigates these attacks
by maintaining a cryptographically-signed log of
relevant developer actions. By documenting the state
of the repository at a particular time when an action is
taken, developers are given a shared history, so irregularities
are easily detected. Our prototype implementation
of the scheme can be deployed immediately as it is
backwards compatible and preserves current workflows
and use cases for Git users. An evaluation shows that
the defense adds a modest overhead while offering significantly
stronger security. We performed responsible
disclosure of the attacks and are working with the Git
community to fix these issues in an upcoming version of
Git."

    abstract: "Community repositories, such as Docker Hub, PyPI, and RubyGems,
are bustling marketplaces that distribute software. Even though these repositories
use common software signing techniques (e.g., GPG and TLS), attackers can
still publish malicious packages after a server compromise. This is mainly
because a community repository must have immediate access to signing keys in order
to certify the large number of new projects that are registered each day.

This work demonstrates that community repositories can offer compromise-resilience
and real-time project registration by employing mechanisms that disambiguate trust delegations.
This is done through two delegation mechanisms that provide flexibility in the
amount of trust assigned to different keys. Using this idea we implement Diplomat,
a software update framework that supports security models with different security / usability tradeoffs.
By leveraging Diplomat, a community repository can achieve near-perfect compromise-resilience
while allowing real-time project registration. For example, when Diplomat is deployed
and configured to maximize security on Python's community repository, less than 1%
of users will be at risk even if an attacker controls the repository and is
undetected for a month. Diplomat is being integrated by Ruby, CoreOS, Haskell,
OCaml, and Python, and has already been deployed by Flynn, LEAP, and Docker."

The minimum security model proposed by PEP 458 supports continuous delivery of distributions (because they are signed by online keys), but that model does not protect distributions in the event that PyPI is compromised. In the minimum security model, attackers may sign for malicious distributions by compromising the signing keys stored on PyPI infrastructure. The maximum security model, described in this PEP, retains the benefits of PEP 458 (e.g., immediate availability of distributions that are uploaded to PyPI), but additionally ensures that end-users are not at risk of installing forged software if PyPI is compromised.

This PEP discusses the changes made to PEP 458 but excludes its informational elements to primarily focus on the maximum security model. For example, an overview of The Update Framework or the basic mechanisms in PEP 458 are not covered here. The changes to PEP 458 include modifications to the snapshot process, key compromise analysis, auditing snapshots, and the steps that should be taken in the event of a PyPI compromise. The signing and key management process that PyPI MAY RECOMMEND is discussed but not strictly defined. How the release process should be implemented to manage keys and metadata is left to the implementors of the signing tools. That is, this PEP delineates the expected cryptographic key type and signature format included in metadata that MUST be uploaded by developers in order to support end-to-end verification of distributions."

    abstract: "Metadata manipulation attacks represent a new threat
class directed against Version Control Systems, such as
the popular Git. This type of attack provides inconsistent
views of a repository state to different developers,
and deceives them into performing unintended operations
with often negative consequences. These include
omitting security patches, merging untested code into a
production branch, and even inadvertently installing software
containing known vulnerabilities. To make matters
worse, the attacks are subtle by nature and leave no trace
after being executed.
We propose a defense scheme that mitigates these attacks
by maintaining a cryptographically-signed log of
relevant developer actions. By documenting the state
of the repository at a particular time when an action is
taken, developers are given a shared history, so irregularities
are easily detected. Our prototype implementation
of the scheme can be deployed immediately as it is
backwards compatible and preserves current workflows
and use cases for Git users. An evaluation shows that
the defense adds a modest overhead while offering significantly
stronger security. We performed responsible
disclosure of the attacks and are working with the Git
community to fix these issues in an upcoming version of
Git."

    abstract: "Community repositories, such as Docker Hub, PyPI, and RubyGems, are bustling marketplaces that distribute software. Even though these repositories use common software signing techniques (e.g., GPG and TLS), attackers can still publish malicious packages after a server compromise. This is mainly because a community repository must have immediate access to signing keys in order to certify the large number of new projects that are registered each day.

This work demonstrates that community repositories can offer compromise-resilience and real-time project registration by employing mechanisms that disambiguate trust delegations. This is done through two delegation mechanisms that provide flexibility in the amount of trust assigned to different keys. Using this idea we implement Diplomat, a software update framework that supports security models with different security / usability tradeoffs. By leveraging Diplomat, a community repository can achieve near-perfect compromise-resilience while allowing real-time project registration. For example, when Diplomat is deployed and configured to maximize security on Python's community repository, less than 1% of users will be at risk even if an attacker controls the repository and is undetected for a month. Diplomat is being integrated by Ruby, CoreOS, Haskell, OCaml, and Python, and has already been deployed by Flynn, LEAP, and Docker."

to retrieve information from a database without revealing
which information in the database was queried. The traditional
information-theoretic PIR schemes utilize multiple servers to
download a single data block, thus incurring high communication
overhead and high computation burdens. In this paper,
we develop an information-theoretic multi-block PIR scheme
that significantly reduces client communication and computation
overheads by downloading multiple data blocks at a time. The
design of k-safe binary matrices insures the information will not
be revealed even if up to k servers collude. Our scheme has much
lower overhead than classic PIR schemes. The implementation of
fast XOR operations benefits both servers and clients in reducing
coding and decoding time. Our work demonstrates that multiblock
PIR scheme can be optimized to simultaneously achieve
low communication and computation overhead, comparable to
even non-PIR systems, while maintaining a high level of privacy."

    abstract: "Many APIs enable cross-platform system development
by abstracting over the details of a platform, allowing
application developers to write one implementation that will run
on a wide variety of platforms. Unfortunately, subtle differences
in the behavior of the underlying platforms make cross-platform
behavior difficult to achieve. As a result, applications using these
APIs can be plagued by bugs difficult to observe before deployment.
These portability bugs can be particularly difficult to
diagnose and fix because they arise from the API implementation,
the operating system, or hardware, rather than application code.
This paper describes CheckAPI, a technique for detecting
violations of cross-platform portability. CheckAPI compares an
application's interactions with the API implementation to its interactions
with a partial specification-based API implementation,
and does so efficiently enough to be used in real production
systems and at runtime. CheckAPI finds latent errors that escape
pre-release testing. This paper discusses the subtleties of different
kinds of API calls and strategies for effectively producing the
partial implementations. Validating CheckAPI on JavaScript,
the Seattle project's Repy VM, and POSIX detects dozens of
violations that are confirmed bugs in widely-used software."

One can draw a parallel between this model of thinking and techniques used in test-driven development, where students learn by thinking about how to effectively test their code and anticipate possible bugs. In this study, we analyzed the quality of both attack and defense code that students wrote for an assignment given in an introductory security class of 75 (both graduate and senior undergraduate levels) at NYU. We made several observations regarding students' behaviors and the quality of both their defensive and offensive code. We saw that student defensive programs (i.e., assignments) are highly unique and that their attack programs (i.e., test cases) are also relatively unique. In addition, we examined how student behaviors in writing defense programs correlated with their attack program's effectiveness. We found evidence that students who learn to write good defensive programs can write effective attack programs, but the converse is not true. While further exploration of causality is needed, our results indicate that a greater pedagogical emphasis on defensive security may benefit students more than one that emphasizes offense."

This paper presents a framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of the individual components in a mobile system, as well as the entire system. The major components are applications, devices and networks of devices. Given this diversity and multiple levels of a mobile system, we develop a hierarchical trust evaluation methodology, which enables the combination of trust metrics and allows us to verify the trust metric for each component based on the trust metrics for others. The paper first demonstrates this idea for individual applications and Android-based smartphones. The methodology involves two stages: initial trust evaluation and trust verification. In the first stage, an expert rule system is used to produce trust metrics at the lowest level of the hierarchy. In the second stage, the trust metrics are verified by comparing data from components and a trust evaluation is produced for the combined system. This paper presents the results of two empirical studies, in which this methodology is applied and tested. The first study involves monitoring resource utilization and evaluating trust based on resource consumption patterns. We measured battery voltage, CPU utilization and network communication for individual apps and detected anomalous behavior that could be indicative of malicious code. The second study involves verification of the trust evaluation by comparing the data from two different devices: the GPS location from an Android smartphone in an automobile and the data from an on-board diagnostics (OBD) sensor of the same vehicle."

Data such as speed, engine RPM, fuel consumption, GPS locations, etc. are collected from moving vehicles by using a WiFi On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) sensor, and then backhauled to a remote server for both real-time and offline analysis. We describe the design and implementation details of our platform, for which we developed a library for in-vehicle sensor access and created a non-relational database for scalable backend data storage.

We present TAMER, an OS mechanism that interposes on events and signals that cause task wakeups, and allows for their detailed monitoring, filtering, and rate-limiting. We demonstrate how TAMER can help reduce battery drain in scenarios involving popular Android apps with background tasks. We also show how TAMER can mitigate the effects of well-known energy bugs while maintaining most of the apps' functionality. Finally, we elaborate on how developers and users can devise their own application-control policies for TAMER to maximize battery lifetime."

to the existing infrastructure. Without adequate foresight,
industry, academia, and government can be caught
flat-footed. In this work, we focus on the trends surrounding
home Internet bandwidth - the bandwidth required
by end user applications at home. As building and
managing last mile network infrastructure incurs substantial
cost, the foresight of such trends is necessary to
plan upgrades.
Using a bottom-up approach, we look at four potentially
disruptive technologies, including millimeter wave
wireless (mm-wave), the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog
Computing, and Software Defined Networking (SDN).
We examine use cases proposed by academia and industry,
delve into the bandwidth requirements for proposed
applications, and use this data to forecast future traffic
demands for typical home users. Our projections show
that bandwidth changes at end user devices will most
likely be driven by two of the above technologies: millimeter
wave wireless and Fog Computing. These technologies
not only change the peak bandwidth, but also
have noticeable secondary effects on bandwidth such as
increasing upload bandwidth use, improving flash crowd
tolerance, and increasing off-peak demand. While IoT
and SDN are important, innovative technologies, they
will not drastically alter the bandwidth usage patterns of
ordinary users at home. We hope that the data and recommendations
from this study can help business leaders

In this work we perform a large-scale analysis of Twitter to study the prevalence and behavior of Anonymous and Identifiable users. We employ Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to classify Twitter users as Highly Identifiable, Identifiable, Partially Anonymous, and Anonymous. We find that a significant fraction of accounts are Anonymous or Partially Anonymous, demonstrating the importance of Anonymity in Twitter. We then select several broad topic categories that are widely considered sensitive--including pornography, escort services, sexual orientation, religious and racial hatred, online drugs, and guns--and find that there is a correlation between content sensitivity and a user's choice to be anonymous. Finally, we find that Anonymous users are generally less inhibited to be active participants, as they tweet more, lurk less, follow more accounts, and are more willing to expose their activity to the general public. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis of user anonymity in online social networks."

    abstract: "This paper introduces NetCheck, a tool designed to diagnose network problems in large and complex applications. NetCheck relies on blackbox tracing mechanisms, such as strace, to automatically collect sequences of network system call invocations generated by the application hosts. NetCheck performs its diagnosis by (1) totally ordering the distributed set of input traces, and by (2) utilizing a network model to identify points in the totally ordered execution where the traces deviated from expected network semantics.

Our evaluation demonstrates that NetCheck is able to diagnose failures in popular and complex applications without relying on any application- or network-specific information. For instance, NetCheck correctly identified the existence of NAT devices, simultaneous network disconnection/ reconnection, and platform portability issues. In a more targeted evaluation, NetCheck correctly detects over 95% of the network problems we found from bug trackers of projects like Python, Apache, and Ruby. When applied to traces of faults reproduced in a live network, NetCheck identified the primary cause of the fault in 90% of the cases. Additionally, NetCheck is efficient and can process a GB-long trace in about 2 minutes."

    abstract: "Over the years, we have witnessed various password-hash database breaches that have affected small and large companies, with a diversity of users and budgets. The industry standard, salted hashing (and even key stretching), has proven to be insufficient protection against attackers who now have access to clusters of GPU-powered password crackers. Although there are various proposals for better securing password storage, most do not offer the same adoption model (software-only, server-side) as salted hashing, which may impede adoption. In this paper, we present PolyPasswordHasher, a software-only, server-side password storage mechanism that requires minimal additional work for the server, but exponentially increases the attacker's effort. PolyPasswordHasher uses a threshold cryptosystem to interrelate stored password data so that passwords cannot be individually cracked. Our analysis shows that PolyPasswordHasher is memory and storage efficient, hard to crack, and easy to implement. In many realistic scenarios, cracking a PolyPasswordHasher-enabled database would be infeasible even for an adversary with millions of computers."

    abstract: "One of the central skills in computer security is reasoning about how programs fail. As a result, computer security necessarily involves thinking about the corner cases that arise when software executes. An unfortunate side effect of this is that computer security assignments typically necessitate deep understanding of a topic, such as how the stack is laid out in memory or how web applications interact with databases. This work presents a series of assignments that require very little background knowledge from students, yet provide them with the ability to reason about failures in programs. In this set of assignments, students implement two very simple programs in a high-level language (Python). Students first implement a reference monitor that tries to uphold a security property within a sandbox. For the second portion, the students are provided each others' reference monitors and then write attack code to try to bypass the reference monitors. By leveraging a Python-based sandbox, student code is isolated cleanly, which simplifies development and grading. These assignments have been used in about a dozen classes in a range of environments, including a research university, online classes, and a four year liberal arts school. Student and instructor feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore, survey results demonstrate that after a 2-3 week module, 76% of the students who did not understand reference monitors and access control learned these key security concepts."

    abstract: "Despite the security community's emphasis on the importance of building secure software, the number of new vulnerabilities found in our systems is increasing. In addition, vulnerabilities that have been studied for years are still commonly reported in vulnerability databases. This paper investigates a new hypothesis that software vulnerabilities are blind spots in developer's heuristic-based decision-making processes. Heuristics are simple computational models to solve problems without considering all the information available. They are an adaptive response to our short working memory because they require less cognitive effort. Our hypothesis is that as software vulnerabilities represent corner cases that exercise unusual information flows, they tend to be left out from the repertoire of heuristics used by developers during their programming tasks.

To validate this hypothesis we conducted a study with 47 developers using psychological manipulation. In this study each developer worked for approximately one hour on six vulnerable programming scenarios. The sessions progressed from providing no information about the possibility of vulnerabilities, to priming developers about unexpected results, and explicitly mentioning the existence of vulnerabilities in the code. The results show that (i) security is not a priority in software development environments, (ii) security is not part of developer's mindset while coding, (iii) developers assume common cases for their code, (iv) security thinking requires cognitive effort, (v) security education helps, but developers can have difficulties correlating a particular learned vulnerability or security information with their current working task, and (vi) priming or explicitly cueing about vulnerabilities on-the-spot is a powerful mechanism to make developers aware about potential vulnerabilities."

    abstract: "The security community spares no effort in emphasizing security awareness and the importance of building secure software. However, the number of new vulnerabilities found in today's systems is still increasing. Furthermore, old and well-studied vulnerability types such as buffer overflows and SQL injections, are still repeatedly reported in vulnerability databases. Historically, the common response has been to blame the developers for their lack of security education. This paper discusses a new hypothesis to explain this problem by introducing a new security paradigm where software vulnerabilities are viewed as developers' blind spots in their decision making. We argue that such a flawed mental process is heuristic-based, where humans solve problems without considering all the information available, just like taking shortcuts. This paper's thesis is that security thinking tends to be left out by developers during their programming, as vulnerabilities usually exist in corner cases with unusual information flows. Leveraging this paradigm, this paper introduces a novel methodology for capturing and understanding security-related blind spots in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Finally, it discusses how this methodology can be applied to the design and implementation of the next generation of automated diagnosis tools."

    abstract: "Application failures due to network issues are some of the most difficult to diagnose
and debug. This is because the failure may be due to in-network state or
state maintained by a remote end-host, both of which are invisible to an application
host. For instance, data may be dropped due to MTU issues [18], NAT
devices and firewalls introduce problems due to address changes and connection
blocking [11], default IPv6 options can cause IPv4 applications to fail [3],
and default buffer size settings can cause UDP datagrams to be dropped or
truncated [37].
This report presents the results of our work NetCheck [38]. In contrast
with most prior approaches, NetCheck does not require application- or networkspecific
knowledge to perform its diagnoses, and no modification to the application
or the infrastructure is necessary. NetCheck treats an application as a
blackbox and requires just a set of system call (syscall) invocation traces from
the relevant end-hosts. These traces can be easily collected at runtime with standard
blackbox tracing tools, such as strace. To perform its diagnosis, NetCheck
derives a global ordering of the input syscalls by simulating the syscalls against
a network model. The model is also used to identify those syscalls that deviate
from expected network semantics. These deviations are then mapped to a
diagnosis by using a set of heuristics."

In this work, we discuss one such testbed, Seattle. Seattle is an open research and educational testbed that utilizes computational resources provided by end users on their existing devices. Unlike most other platforms, resources are not dedicated to the platform which allows a greater degree of network diversity and realism at the cost of programmability. Seattle is designed to preserve user security and to minimally impact application performance. We describe the architectural design of Seattle, and summarize our experiences with Seattle over the past few years as both researchers and educators. We have found that Seattle is very easy to adopt due to cross-platform support, and is also surprisingly easy for students to use. While there are programmability limitations, it is possible to construct complex applications integrated with real devices, networks, and users with Seattle as a core component. From an educational standpoint, Seattle has been shown not only to be useful as a teaching tool, it has been successful in variety of different systems classes at a variety of different types of schools. In our experience, when low-level programmability is not the main requirement, Seattle can supersede many existing testbeds for diverse educational and research tasks"

A study was undertaken to research information posted on the web concerning recent, high
profile website intrusions, wherein user login credentials and other data were compromised. We
searched for the party responsible for the incursion, the attack mechanism utilized, the format in
which the login data was stored, and the location of any password dumps pilfered from the site.
News stories from trade related journals, press releases from the victim company, hacker sites,
and blogs from individuals and companies engaged in security analysis were, in particular,
searched in order to find related information. A total of thirty four breaches were researched. It
should be noted that some dumps, previously published, no longer exist. This is due to either
the affected parties taking action against the site posting them, expiration of the allowed posting
period, or removal by the original poster. An effort was made to locate copies of these files,
sometimes to no avail. In those cases, details concerning the contents of the dumps were
collected from published reports about them."

    abstract: "This PEP proposes how the Python Package Index (PyPI [1]) should be integrated with The Update Framework [2] (TUF). TUF was designed to be a flexible security add-on to a software updater or package manager. The framework integrates best security practices such as separating role responsibilities, adopting the many-man rule for signing packages, keeping signing keys offline, and revocation of expired or compromised signing keys. For example, attackers would have to steal multiple signing keys stored independently to compromise a role responsible for specifying a repository's available files. Another role responsible for indicating the latest snapshot of the repository may have to be similarly compromised, and independent of the first compromised role.

The proposed integration will allow modern package managers such as pip [3] to be more secure against various types of security attacks on PyPI and protect users from such attacks. Specifically, this PEP describes how PyPI processes should be adapted to generate and incorporate TUF metadata (i.e., the minimum security model). The minimum security model supports verification of PyPI distributions that are signed with keys stored on PyPI: distributions uploaded by developers are signed by PyPI, require no action from developers (other than uploading the distribution), and are immediately available for download. The minimum security model also minimizes PyPI administrative responsibilities by automating much of the signing process.

This PEP does not prescribe how package managers such as pip should be adapted to install or update projects from PyPI with TUF metadata. Package managers interested in adopting TUF on the client side may consult TUF's library documentation [27], which exists for this purpose. Support for project distributions that are signed by developers (maximum security model) is also not discussed in this PEP, but is outlined in the appendix as a possible future extension and covered in detail in PEP 480 [26]. The PEP 480 extension focuses on the maximum security model, which requires more PyPI administrative work (none by clients), but it also proposes an easy-to-use key management solution for developers, how to interface with a potential future build farm on PyPI infrastructure, and discusses the feasibility of end-to-end signing."

managing last mile network infrastructure incurs substantial
cost, the foresight of such trends is necessary to
plan upgrades.
Using a bottom-up approach, we look at four potentially
disruptive technologies, including millimeter wave
wireless (mm-wave), the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog
Computing, and Software Defined Networking (SDN).
We examine use cases proposed by academia and industry,
delve into the bandwidth requirements for proposed
applications, and use this data to forecast future traffic
demands for typical home users. Our projections show
that bandwidth changes at end user devices will most
likely be driven by two of the above technologies: millimeter
wave wireless and Fog Computing. These technologies
not only change the peak bandwidth, but also
have noticeable secondary effects on bandwidth such as
increasing upload bandwidth use, improving flash crowd
tolerance, and increasing off-peak demand. While IoT

will not drastically alter the bandwidth usage patterns of
ordinary users at home. We hope that the data and recommendations

compositions of virtual components are different than current

to further both the users understanding of them, and future

there has been a lack of research into quantifying
and improving portability of a programming environment.
We have constructed a distributed testbed
called Seattle built on a platform-independent programming
API that is implemented on different operating systems
and architectures. Our goal is to show that applications
written to our API will be portable.
In this work, we use an instrumented version of the
programming environment for testing purposes. The instrumentation
allows us to gather traces of actual program
behavior from a running implementation. These
traces can be used across different versions of the implementation
exactly as if they were test cases generated
offline from a model program, so we can commence testing
using model based testing tools, without constructing
a model program.
Such offline testing is only effective in scenarios
where traces are expected to be reproducible (deterministic).
Where reproducibility is not expected, for instance
due to nondeterminism in the network environment, we
must resort to on-the-fly testing, which does require a
model program. To validate this model program, we
can use the recorded traces of actual behavior. Validating
with captured traces should provide greater coverage
than we could achieve by validating only with traces constructed
a priori."

    abstract: "Today’s software update systems have little or no defense
against key compromise. As a result, key compromises have
put millions of software update clients at risk. Here we identify
three classes of information whose authenticity and integrity
are critical for secure software updates. Analyzing
existing software update systems with our framework, we
find their ability to communicate this information securely
in the event of a key compromise to be weak or nonexistent.
We also find that the security problems in current software
update systems are compounded by inadequate trust revocation
mechanisms. We identify core security principles that
allow software update systems to survive key compromise.
Using these ideas, we design and implement TUF, a software
update framework that increases resilience to key compromise."

    abstract: "Flaws in the standard libraries of secure sandboxes represent
a major security threat to billions of devices worldwide. The
standard libraries are hard to secure because they frequently
need to perform low-level operations that are forbidden in
untrusted application code. Existing designs have a single,
large trusted computing base that contains security checks
at the boundaries between trusted and untrusted code. Unfortunately,
flaws in the standard library often allow an attacker
to escape the security protections of the sandbox.
In this work, we construct a Python-based sandbox that
has a small, security-isolated kernel. Using a mechanism
called a security layer, we migrate privileged functionality
into memory-safe code on top of the sandbox kernel while retaining
isolation. For example, significant portions of module
import, file I/O, serialization, and network communication
routines can be provided in security layers. By moving
these routines out of the kernel, we prevent attackers from
leveraging bugs in these routines to evade sandbox containment.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
studying past bugs in Java’s standard libraries and show
that most of these bugs would likely be contained in our
sandbox."

    abstract: "Cloud computing is rapidly increasing in popularity. Companies
such as RedHat, Microsoft, Amazon, Goog
le, and
IBM are increasingly funding cloud computing infrastructure
and research, making it important for students to gain
the necessary skills to work with cloud-based resources. This
paper presents a free, educational research platform called
Seattle that is community-driven, a common denominator
for diverse platform types, and is broadly deployed.
Seattle is community-driven - universities donate available
compute resources on multi-user machines to the platform.
These donations can come from systems with a wide
variety of systems operating and architectures, removing the
need for a dedicated infrastructure.
Seattle is also surprisingly flexible and supports a variety
of pedagogical uses because as a platform it represents a
common denominator for cloud computing, grid computing,
peer-to-peer networking, distributed systems, and networking.
Seattle programs are portable. Students' code can run
across different operating systems and architectures without
change, while the Seattle programming language is expressive
enough for experimentation at a fine-grained level. Our
current deployment of Seattle consists of about one thousand
computers that are distributed around the world. We
invite the computer science education community to employ
Seattle in their courses."
