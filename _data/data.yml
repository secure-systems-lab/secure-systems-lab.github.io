    comprehensive, flexible framework to secure software updates even in situations
    where the software repository is compromised. Developers can integrate TUF

Even if developers are careful to secure each step in their products' supply chain, there is little assurance about what happens in-between these steps.

As such, in-toto provides accountability about how software is written, packaged and distributed...and by who."

      abstract: "Version Control Systems (VCS-es) play a major role in the software development life cycle,
      yet historically their security has been relatively underdeveloped compared to their importance.
      Recent history has shown that source code repositories represent appealing attack targets. Attacks that
      violate the integrity of repository data can impact negatively millions of users. Some VCS-es,
      such as Git, employ com- mit signatures as a mechanism to provide developers with cryptographic
      protections for the code they contribute to a repository. However, an entire class of other VCS-es,
      including the well-known Apache Subversion (SVN), lacks such protections. We design the first commit
      signing mechanism for centralized version control systems, which supports features such as working
      with a subset of the repository and allowing clients to work on disjoint sets of files without
      having to retrieve each other’s changes. We implement a prototype for the proposed commit signing
      mechanism on top of the SVN codebase and show experimentally that it only incurs a modest overhead.
      With our solution in place, the VCS security model is substantially improved."

  about their security. This is due, in part, to complex collusion
  cases and new threat vectors, that could be missed by conventional security assessment
  strategies. To address these issues, we propose ABC, an Asset-Based
  Cryptocurrency-focused threat modeling framework
  capable of identifying such risks. ABC’s key innovation is the use of
  collusion matrices. A collusion matrix forces a threat model to
  cover a large space of threat cases while simultaneously manages this
  process to prevent it from being overly complex. We demonstrate that ABC is
  effective by presenting real-world use cases and by conducting a user study.
  The user study showed that around 71% of those who used ABC were able to
  identify financial security threats, as compared to only 13% of participants
  who used the popular framework STRIDE."

  can misunderstand or misuse them, introducing vulnerabilities. We
  call the causes of such misuse blindspots. In this paper, we study
  API blindspots from the developers’ perspective to: (1) determine
  the extent to which developers can detect API blindspots in code
  and (2) examine the extent to which developer characteristics (i.e.,
  perception of code correctness, familiarity with code, confidence,
  professional experience, cognitive function, and personality) affect
  this capability. We conducted a study with 109 developers from
  four countries solving programming puzzles that involve Java APIs
  known to contain blindspots. We find that (1) The presence of
  blindspots correlated negatively with the developers’ accuracy in
  answering implicit security questions and the developers’ ability to
  identify potential security concerns in the code. This effect was
  more pronounced for I/O-related APIs and for puzzles with higher
  cyclomatic complexity. (2) Higher cognitive functioning and more
  programming experience did not predict better ability to detect API
  blindspots. (3) Developers exhibiting greater openness as a personality
  trait were more likely to detect API blindspots. This study has
  the potential to advance API security in (1) design, implementation,
  and testing of new APIs; (2) addressing blindspots in legacy
  APIs; (3) development of novel methods for developer recruitment
  and training based on cognitive and personality assessments; and
  (4) improvement of software development processes (e.g., establishment
  of security and functionality teams)."

  responsible for valuable network measurements and major advances in distributed
  systems research. However, no single testbed can satisfy the requirements of
  every research project,prompting continual efforts to develop new testbeds.
  The common practice is to re-implement functionality anew for each testbed.
  This work introduces a set of ready-to-use software components and interfaces
  called Tsumiki to help researchers to rapidly prototype custom networked testbeds
  without substantial effort. We derive Tsumiki’s design using a set of component
  and interface design principles, and demonstrate that Tsumiki can be used to
   implement new, diverse, and useful testbeds. We detail a few such testbeds: a
  testbed composed of Android devices, a testbed that uses Docker for sandboxing,
  and a testbed that shares computation and storage resources among Facebook friends.
  A user study demonstrated that students with no prior experience with networked
  testbeds were able to use Tsumiki to create a testbed with new functionality and
  run an experiment on this testbed in under an hour.
  Furthermore, Tsumiki has been used in production in multiple testbeds,
  resulting in installations on tens of thousands of devices and

      abstract: "Web-based Git hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab are popular
  choices to manage and interact with Git repositories. However, they lack
  an important security feature—the ability to sign Git commits. Users
  instruct the server to perform repository operations on their behalf and
  have to trust that the server will execute their requests faithfully.
  Such trust may be unwarranted though because a malicious or a
  compromised server may execute the requested actions in an incorrect
  manner, leading to a different state of the repository than what the
  user intended.
  
  In this paper, we show a range of high-impact attacks that can be
  executed stealthily when developers use the web UI of a Git hosting
  service to perform common actions such as editing files or merging
  branches. We then propose le-git-imate, a defense against these attacks
  which provides security guarantees comparable and compatible with Git's
  standard commit signing mechanism. We implement le-git-imate as a Chrome
  browser extension.  le-git-imate
  does not require changes on the server side and can thus be used
  immediately. It also preserves current workflows used in Github/GitLab
  and does not require the user to leave the browser, and it allows anyone
  to verify that the server's actions faithfully follow the user's
  requested actions.  Moreover, experimental evaluation using the browser
  extension shows that le-git-imate has comparable performance with Git's
  standard commit signature mechanism.  With our solution in place, users
  can take advantage of GitHub/GitLab's web-based features without
  sacrificing security, thus paving the way towards verifiable web-based
  Git repositories."

      software is on an electronic control unit (ECU) in a vehicle,
  exploitation of these bugs can have life or death
  consequences. Since software for vehicles is likely to
  proliferate and grow more complex in time, the number
  of exploitable vulnerabilities will increase. As a result,
  manufacturers are keenly aware of the need to quickly
  and efficiently deploy updates so that software vulnerabilities
  can be remedied as soon as possible.
  However, existing software-update security systems
  are not compromise resilient; if an attacker breaks into
  any portion of an automobile’s infrastructure, they could
  compromise numerous vehicles. The industry needs to
  dynamically choose updates for vehicles based on fresh
  information, forcing manufacturers to choose existing
  systems that sign updates using a key stored on the
  server. Attackers who compromise the repository can abuse this online key and cause malicious software to be
  installed on vehicles.
  In this article we discuss Uptane, the first, to our

      or RubyGems distributes tens of thousands of soft- ware projects to
      millions of users. The large number of projects and users make these
      repositories attractive targets for exploitation. After a repository
      compromise, a malicious party can launch a number of attacks on
      unsuspecting users, including rollback attacks that revert projects to
      obsolete and vulnerable versions. Unfortunately, due to the rapid rate
      at which packages are updated, existing techniques that protect against
      rollback attacks would cause each user to download 2–3 times the size of an
      average package in metadata each month, making them impractical to deploy.
  
      In this work, we develop a system called Mercury that uses a novel technique
      to compactly disseminate version information while still protecting against
      rollback attacks. Due to a different technique for dealing with key
      revocation, users are protected from rollback attacks, even if the software
      repository is compromised. This technique is bandwidth-efficient,
      especially when delta compression is used to transmit only the
      differences between previous and current lists of version information.
      An analysis we performed for the Python community shows that once Mercury
      is deployed on PyPI, each user will only download metadata each month
      that is about 3.5% the size of an average package. Our work has been
      incorporated into the latest versions of TUF, which is being integrated by
      Haskell, OCaml, RubyGems, Python, and CoreOS, and is being used in

  the subject does real-world activities. There are also few direct

  attack without compromising any signing key) or that can
  cause a vehicle to become unsafe. In this paper, we present Uptane,
  the first software update framework for automobiles that counters
  a comprehensive array of security attacks, and is resilient to partial
  compromises. Uptane adds strategic features to the state-of-the-art
  software update framework, TUF, in order to address automotivespecific
  vulnerabilities and limitations. Uptane is flexible and easy
  to adopt, and its design details were developed together with the
  main automotive industry stakeholders in the USA."

      abstract: "Metadata manipulation attacks represent a new threat
  class directed against Version Control Systems, such as
  the popular Git. This type of attack provides inconsistent
  views of a repository state to different developers,
  and deceives them into performing unintended operations
  with often negative consequences. These include
  omitting security patches, merging untested code into a
  production branch, and even inadvertently installing software
  containing known vulnerabilities. To make matters
  worse, the attacks are subtle by nature and leave no trace
  after being executed.
  We propose a defense scheme that mitigates these attacks
  by maintaining a cryptographically-signed log of
  relevant developer actions. By documenting the state
  of the repository at a particular time when an action is
  taken, developers are given a shared history, so irregularities
  are easily detected. Our prototype implementation
  of the scheme can be deployed immediately as it is
  backwards compatible and preserves current workflows
  and use cases for Git users. An evaluation shows that
  the defense adds a modest overhead while offering significantly
  stronger security. We performed responsible
  disclosure of the attacks and are working with the Git
  community to fix these issues in an upcoming version of
  Git."

      abstract: "Community repositories, such as Docker Hub, PyPI, and RubyGems,
  are bustling marketplaces that distribute software. Even though these repositories
  use common software signing techniques (e.g., GPG and TLS), attackers can
  still publish malicious packages after a server compromise. This is mainly
  because a community repository must have immediate access to signing keys in order
  to certify the large number of new projects that are registered each day.
  
  This work demonstrates that community repositories can offer compromise-resilience
  and real-time project registration by employing mechanisms that disambiguate trust delegations.
  This is done through two delegation mechanisms that provide flexibility in the
  amount of trust assigned to different keys. Using this idea we implement Diplomat,
  a software update framework that supports security models with different security / usability tradeoffs.
  By leveraging Diplomat, a community repository can achieve near-perfect compromise-resilience
  while allowing real-time project registration. For example, when Diplomat is deployed
  and configured to maximize security on Python's community repository, less than 1%
  of users will be at risk even if an attacker controls the repository and is
  undetected for a month. Diplomat is being integrated by Ruby, CoreOS, Haskell,
  OCaml, and Python, and has already been deployed by Flynn, LEAP, and Docker."

      abstract: "Proposed is an extension to PEP 458 that adds support for end-to-end signing and the maximum security model. End-to-end signing allows both PyPI and developers to sign for the distributions that are downloaded by clients. The minimum security model proposed by PEP 458 supports continuous delivery of distributions (because they are signed by online keys), but that model does not protect distributions in the event that PyPI is compromised. In the minimum security model, attackers may sign for malicious distributions by compromising the signing keys stored on PyPI infrastructure. The maximum security model, described in this PEP, retains the benefits of PEP 458 (e.g., immediate availability of distributions that are uploaded to PyPI), but additionally ensures that end-users are not at risk of installing forged software if PyPI is compromised.
  
  This PEP discusses the changes made to PEP 458 but excludes its informational elements to primarily focus on the maximum security model. For example, an overview of The Update Framework or the basic mechanisms in PEP 458 are not covered here. The changes to PEP 458 include modifications to the snapshot process, key compromise analysis, auditing snapshots, and the steps that should be taken in the event of a PyPI compromise. The signing and key management process that PyPI MAY RECOMMEND is discussed but not strictly defined. How the release process should be implemented to manage keys and metadata is left to the implementors of the signing tools. That is, this PEP delineates the expected cryptographic key type and signature format included in metadata that MUST be uploaded by developers in order to support end-to-end verification of distributions."

  app, even if low priority, can cause performance degradation,
  loss of battery life, or other issues that reduce a
  computing device's availability. The core problem is that
  OS resource control mechanisms unevenly apply uncoordinated
  policies across different resources. This paper shows how handling resources - e.g., CPU, memory, sockets,
  and bandwidth - in coordination, through a unifying
  abstraction, can be both simpler and more effective. We
  abstract resources along two dimensions of fungibility
  and renewability, to enable resource-agnostic algorithms
  to provide resource limits for a diverse set of applications.
  We demonstrate the power of our resource abstraction
  with a prototype resource control subsystem, Fence,
  which we implement for two sandbox environments running
  on a wide variety of operating systems (Windows,
  Linux, the BSDs, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, OLPC, and
  Nokia) and device types (servers, desktops, tablets, laptops,
  and smartphones). We use Fence to provide systemwide
  protection against resource hogging processes that
  include limiting battery drain, preventing overheating,
  and isolating performance. Even when there is interference,
  Fence can double the battery life and improve the
  responsiveness of other applications by an order of magnitude.
  Fence is publicly available and has been deployed
  in practice for five years, protecting tens of thousands of

  we develop an information-theoretic multi-block PIR scheme
  that significantly reduces client communication and computation
  overheads by downloading multiple data blocks at a time. The
  design of k-safe binary matrices insures the information will not
  be revealed even if up to k servers collude. Our scheme has much
  lower overhead than classic PIR schemes. The implementation of

  by abstracting over the details of a platform, allowing

  on a wide variety of platforms. Unfortunately, subtle differences
  in the behavior of the underlying platforms make cross-platform
  behavior difficult to achieve. As a result, applications using these
  APIs can be plagued by bugs difficult to observe before deployment.
  These portability bugs can be particularly difficult to
  diagnose and fix because they arise from the API implementation,
  the operating system, or hardware, rather than application code.
  This paper describes CheckAPI, a technique for detecting
  violations of cross-platform portability. CheckAPI compares an
  application's interactions with the API implementation to its interactions
  with a partial specification-based API implementation,
  and does so efficiently enough to be used in real production
  systems and at runtime. CheckAPI finds latent errors that escape
  pre-release testing. This paper discusses the subtleties of different
  kinds of API calls and strategies for effectively producing the
  partial implementations. Validating CheckAPI on JavaScript,

One can draw a parallel between this model of thinking and techniques used in test-driven development, where students learn by thinking about how to effectively test their code and anticipate possible bugs. In this study, we analyzed the quality of both attack and defense code that students wrote for an assignment given in an introductory security class of 75 (both graduate and senior undergraduate levels) at NYU. We made several observations regarding students' behaviors and the quality of both their defensive and offensive code. We saw that student defensive programs (i.e., assignments) are highly unique and that their attack programs (i.e., test cases) are also relatively unique. In addition, we examined how student behaviors in writing defense programs correlated with their attack program's effectiveness. We found evidence that students who learn to write good defensive programs can write effective attack programs, but the converse is not true. While further exploration of causality is needed, our results indicate that a greater pedagogical emphasis on defensive security may benefit students more than one that emphasizes offense."

This paper presents a framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of the individual components in a mobile system, as well as the entire system. The major components are applications, devices and networks of devices. Given this diversity and multiple levels of a mobile system, we develop a hierarchical trust evaluation methodology, which enables the combination of trust metrics and allows us to verify the trust metric for each component based on the trust metrics for others. The paper first demonstrates this idea for individual applications and Android-based smartphones. The methodology involves two stages: initial trust evaluation and trust verification. In the first stage, an expert rule system is used to produce trust metrics at the lowest level of the hierarchy. In the second stage, the trust metrics are verified by comparing data from components and a trust evaluation is produced for the combined system. This paper presents the results of two empirical studies, in which this methodology is applied and tested. The first study involves monitoring resource utilization and evaluating trust based on resource consumption patterns. We measured battery voltage, CPU utilization and network communication for individual apps and detected anomalous behavior that could be indicative of malicious code. The second study involves verification of the trust evaluation by comparing the data from two different devices: the GPS location from an Android smartphone in an automobile and the data from an on-board diagnostics (OBD) sensor of the same vehicle."

Data such as speed, engine RPM, fuel consumption, GPS locations, etc. are collected from moving vehicles by using a WiFi On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) sensor, and then backhauled to a remote server for both real-time and offline analysis. We describe the design and implementation details of our platform, for which we developed a library for in-vehicle sensor access and created a non-relational database for scalable backend data storage.

We demonstrate how TAMER can help reduce battery drain in scenarios involving popular Android apps with background tasks.

  home Internet bandwidth - the bandwidth required
  by end user applications at home. As building and
  managing last mile network infrastructure incurs substantial
  cost, the foresight of such trends is necessary to
  plan upgrades.
  Using a bottom-up approach, we look at four potentially
  disruptive technologies, including millimeter wave
  wireless (mm-wave), the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog
  Computing, and Software Defined Networking (SDN).
  We examine use cases proposed by academia and industry,
  delve into the bandwidth requirements for proposed
  applications, and use this data to forecast future traffic
  demands for typical home users. Our projections show
  that bandwidth changes at end user devices will most
  likely be driven by two of the above technologies: millimeter
  wave wireless and Fog Computing. These technologies
  not only change the peak bandwidth, but also
  have noticeable secondary effects on bandwidth such as
  increasing upload bandwidth use, improving flash crowd

      abstract: "Twitter does not impose a Real-Name policy for usernames, giving users the freedom to choose how they want to be identified. This results in some users being Identifiable (disclosing their full name) and some being Anonymous (disclosing neither their first nor last name).
  
  In this work we perform a large-scale analysis of Twitter to study the prevalence and behavior of Anonymous and Identifiable users. We employ Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to classify Twitter users as Highly Identifiable, Identifiable, Partially Anonymous, and Anonymous. We find that a significant fraction of accounts are Anonymous or Partially Anonymous, demonstrating the importance of Anonymity in Twitter. We then select several broad topic categories that are widely considered sensitive--including pornography, escort services, sexual orientation, religious and racial hatred, online drugs, and guns--and find that there is a correlation between content sensitivity and a user's choice to be anonymous. Finally, we find that Anonymous users are generally less inhibited to be active participants, as they tweet more, lurk less, follow more accounts, and are more willing to expose their activity to the general public. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis of user anonymity in online social networks."

      abstract: "This paper introduces NetCheck, a tool designed to diagnose network problems in large and complex applications. NetCheck relies on blackbox tracing mechanisms, such as strace, to automatically collect sequences of network system call invocations generated by the application hosts. NetCheck performs its diagnosis by (1) totally ordering the distributed set of input traces, and by (2) utilizing a network model to identify points in the totally ordered execution where the traces deviated from expected network semantics.
  
  Our evaluation demonstrates that NetCheck is able to diagnose failures in popular and complex applications without relying on any application- or network-specific information. For instance, NetCheck correctly identified the existence of NAT devices, simultaneous network disconnection/ reconnection, and platform portability issues. In a more targeted evaluation, NetCheck correctly detects over 95% of the network problems we found from bug trackers of projects like Python, Apache, and Ruby. When applied to traces of faults reproduced in a live network, NetCheck identified the primary cause of the fault in 90% of the cases. Additionally, NetCheck is efficient and can process a GB-long trace in about 2 minutes."

      abstract: "Over the years, we have witnessed various password-hash database breaches that have affected small and large companies, with a diversity of users and budgets. The industry standard, salted hashing (and even key stretching), has proven to be insufficient protection against attackers who now have access to clusters of GPU-powered password crackers. Although there are various proposals for better securing password storage, most do not offer the same adoption model (software-only, server-side) as salted hashing, which may impede adoption. In this paper, we present PolyPasswordHasher, a software-only, server-side password storage mechanism that requires minimal additional work for the server, but exponentially increases the attacker's effort. PolyPasswordHasher uses a threshold cryptosystem to interrelate stored password data so that passwords cannot be individually cracked. Our analysis shows that PolyPasswordHasher is memory and storage efficient, hard to crack, and easy to implement. In many realistic scenarios, cracking a PolyPasswordHasher-enabled database would be infeasible even for an adversary with millions of computers."

      abstract: "One of the central skills in computer security is reasoning about how programs fail. As a result, computer security necessarily involves thinking about the corner cases that arise when software executes. An unfortunate side effect of this is that computer security assignments typically necessitate deep understanding of a topic, such as how the stack is laid out in memory or how web applications interact with databases. This work presents a series of assignments that require very little background knowledge from students, yet provide them with the ability to reason about failures in programs. In this set of assignments, students implement two very simple programs in a high-level language (Python). Students first implement a reference monitor that tries to uphold a security property within a sandbox. For the second portion, the students are provided each others' reference monitors and then write attack code to try to bypass the reference monitors. By leveraging a Python-based sandbox, student code is isolated cleanly, which simplifies development and grading. These assignments have been used in about a dozen classes in a range of environments, including a research university, online classes, and a four year liberal arts school. Student and instructor feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore, survey results demonstrate that after a 2-3 week module, 76% of the students who did not understand reference monitors and access control learned these key security concepts."

      abstract: "Despite the security community's emphasis on the importance of building secure software, the number of new vulnerabilities found in our systems is increasing. In addition, vulnerabilities that have been studied for years are still commonly reported in vulnerability databases. This paper investigates a new hypothesis that software vulnerabilities are blind spots in developer's heuristic-based decision-making processes. Heuristics are simple computational models to solve problems without considering all the information available. They are an adaptive response to our short working memory because they require less cognitive effort. Our hypothesis is that as software vulnerabilities represent corner cases that exercise unusual information flows, they tend to be left out from the repertoire of heuristics used by developers during their programming tasks.
  
  To validate this hypothesis we conducted a study with 47 developers using psychological manipulation. In this study each developer worked for approximately one hour on six vulnerable programming scenarios. The sessions progressed from providing no information about the possibility of vulnerabilities, to priming developers about unexpected results, and explicitly mentioning the existence of vulnerabilities in the code. The results show that (i) security is not a priority in software development environments, (ii) security is not part of developer's mindset while coding, (iii) developers assume common cases for their code, (iv) security thinking requires cognitive effort, (v) security education helps, but developers can have difficulties correlating a particular learned vulnerability or security information with their current working task, and (vi) priming or explicitly cueing about vulnerabilities on-the-spot is a powerful mechanism to make developers aware about potential vulnerabilities."

      abstract: "The security community spares no effort in emphasizing security awareness and the importance of building secure software. However, the number of new vulnerabilities found in today's systems is still increasing. Furthermore, old and well-studied vulnerability types such as buffer overflows and SQL injections, are still repeatedly reported in vulnerability databases. Historically, the common response has been to blame the developers for their lack of security education. This paper discusses a new hypothesis to explain this problem by introducing a new security paradigm where software vulnerabilities are viewed as developers' blind spots in their decision making. We argue that such a flawed mental process is heuristic-based, where humans solve problems without considering all the information available, just like taking shortcuts. This paper's thesis is that security thinking tends to be left out by developers during their programming, as vulnerabilities usually exist in corner cases with unusual information flows. Leveraging this paradigm, this paper introduces a novel methodology for capturing and understanding security-related blind spots in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Finally, it discusses how this methodology can be applied to the design and implementation of the next generation of automated diagnosis tools."

      abstract: "Application failures due to network issues are some of the most difficult to diagnose

  state maintained by a remote end-host, both of which are invisible to an application
  host. For instance, data may be dropped due to MTU issues [18], NAT
  devices and firewalls introduce problems due to address changes and connection
  blocking [11], default IPv6 options can cause IPv4 applications to fail [3],
  and default buffer size settings can cause UDP datagrams to be dropped or
  truncated [37].
  This report presents the results of our work NetCheck [38]. In contrast
  with most prior approaches, NetCheck does not require application- or networkspecific
  knowledge to perform its diagnoses, and no modification to the application
  or the infrastructure is necessary. NetCheck treats an application as a
  blackbox and requires just a set of system call (syscall) invocation traces from
  the relevant end-hosts. These traces can be easily collected at runtime with standard
  blackbox tracing tools, such as strace. To perform its diagnosis, NetCheck
  derives a global ordering of the input syscalls by simulating the syscalls against
  a network model. The model is also used to identify those syscalls that deviate
  from expected network semantics. These deviations are then mapped to a
  diagnosis by using a set of heuristics."

In this work, we discuss one such testbed, Seattle. Seattle is an open research and educational testbed that utilizes computational resources provided by end users on their existing devices. Unlike most other platforms, resources are not dedicated to the platform which allows a greater degree of network diversity and realism at the cost of programmability. Seattle is designed to preserve user security and to minimally impact application performance. We describe the architectural design of Seattle, and summarize our experiences with Seattle over the past few years as both researchers and educators. We have found that Seattle is very easy to adopt due to cross-platform support, and is also surprisingly easy for students to use. While there are programmability limitations, it is possible to construct complex applications integrated with real devices, networks, and users with Seattle as a core component. From an educational standpoint, Seattle has been shown not only to be useful as a teaching tool, it has been successful in variety of different systems classes at a variety of different types of schools. In our experience, when low-level programmability is not the main requirement, Seattle can supersede many existing testbeds for diverse educational and research tasks"

      abstract: "This PEP proposes how the Python Package Index (PyPI [1]) should be integrated with The Update Framework [2] (TUF). TUF was designed to be a flexible security add-on to a software updater or package manager. The framework integrates best security practices such as separating role responsibilities, adopting the many-man rule for signing packages, keeping signing keys offline, and revocation of expired or compromised signing keys. For example, attackers would have to steal multiple signing keys stored independently to compromise a role responsible for specifying a repository's available files. Another role responsible for indicating the latest snapshot of the repository may have to be similarly compromised, and independent of the first compromised role.
  
  The proposed integration will allow modern package managers such as pip [3] to be more secure against various types of security attacks on PyPI and protect users from such attacks. Specifically, this PEP describes how PyPI processes should be adapted to generate and incorporate TUF metadata (i.e., the minimum security model). The minimum security model supports verification of PyPI distributions that are signed with keys stored on PyPI: distributions uploaded by developers are signed by PyPI, require no action from developers (other than uploading the distribution), and are immediately available for download. The minimum security model also minimizes PyPI administrative responsibilities by automating much of the signing process.
  
  This PEP does not prescribe how package managers such as pip should be adapted to install or update projects from PyPI with TUF metadata. Package managers interested in adopting TUF on the client side may consult TUF's library documentation [27], which exists for this purpose. Support for project distributions that are signed by developers (maximum security model) is also not discussed in this PEP, but is outlined in the appendix as a possible future extension and covered in detail in PEP 480 [26]. The PEP 480 extension focuses on the maximum security model, which requires more PyPI administrative work (none by clients), but it also proposes an easy-to-use key management solution for developers, how to interface with a potential future build farm on PyPI infrastructure, and discusses the feasibility of end-to-end signing."

  Using a bottom-up approach, we look at four potentially

  We examine use cases proposed by academia and industry,

  not only change the peak bandwidth, but also
  have noticeable secondary effects on bandwidth such as
  increasing upload bandwidth use, improving flash crowd

  software systems, building and using virtual component
  models provides a new set of software engineering challenges
  in composition and system construction. As a possible solution
  to many modern security problems, it is important to
  understand how virtual component models can be evaluated,
  to further both the users understanding of them, and future
  research in this area. This paper proposes a design and implementation
  strategy for components that run in isolation.
  An evaluation of the efficacy of this approach in terms of
  performance, isolation, security and composition provides
  insight into the possible advantages and disadvantages of a
  virtual component model."

      abstract: "Most home users are not able to troubleshoot advanced network issues themselves. Hours on the phone with an ISP's customer representative is a common way to solve this problem. With the advent of mobile devices with both Wi-Fi and cellular radios, troubleshooters at the ISP have a new back-door into a malfunctioning residential network. However, placing full trust in an ISP is a poor choice for a home user. In this paper we present Extra Technician (ET), a system designed to provide ISPs and others with an environment to troubleshoot home networking in a remote, safe and flexible manner."

      abstract: "Despite widespread OS, network, and hardware heterogeneity,
  there has been a lack of research into quantifying
  and improving portability of a programming environment.
  We have constructed a distributed testbed
  called Seattle built on a platform-independent programming
  API that is implemented on different operating systems
  and architectures. Our goal is to show that applications
  written to our API will be portable.
  In this work, we use an instrumented version of the
  programming environment for testing purposes. The instrumentation
  allows us to gather traces of actual program
  behavior from a running implementation. These
  traces can be used across different versions of the implementation
  exactly as if they were test cases generated
  offline from a model program, so we can commence testing
  using model based testing tools, without constructing
  a model program.
  Such offline testing is only effective in scenarios
  where traces are expected to be reproducible (deterministic).
  Where reproducibility is not expected, for instance
  due to nondeterminism in the network environment, we
  must resort to on-the-fly testing, which does require a
  model program. To validate this model program, we
  can use the recorded traces of actual behavior. Validating
  with captured traces should provide greater coverage
  than we could achieve by validating only with traces constructed
  a priori."

  against key compromise. As a result, key compromises have
  put millions of software update clients at risk. Here we identify
  three classes of information whose authenticity and integrity
  are critical for secure software updates. Analyzing
  existing software update systems with our framework, we
  find their ability to communicate this information securely
  in the event of a key compromise to be weak or nonexistent.
  We also find that the security problems in current software
  update systems are compounded by inadequate trust revocation
  mechanisms. We identify core security principles that
  allow software update systems to survive key compromise.
  Using these ideas, we design and implement TUF, a software
  update framework that increases resilience to key compromise."

      abstract: "Flaws in the standard libraries of secure sandboxes represent
  a major security threat to billions of devices worldwide. The
  standard libraries are hard to secure because they frequently
  need to perform low-level operations that are forbidden in
  untrusted application code. Existing designs have a single,
  large trusted computing base that contains security checks
  at the boundaries between trusted and untrusted code. Unfortunately,
  flaws in the standard library often allow an attacker
  to escape the security protections of the sandbox.
  In this work, we construct a Python-based sandbox that
  has a small, security-isolated kernel. Using a mechanism
  called a security layer, we migrate privileged functionality
  into memory-safe code on top of the sandbox kernel while retaining
  isolation. For example, significant portions of module
  import, file I/O, serialization, and network communication
  routines can be provided in security layers. By moving
  these routines out of the kernel, we prevent attackers from
  leveraging bugs in these routines to evade sandbox containment.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
  studying past bugs in Java’s standard libraries and show
  that most of these bugs would likely be contained in our
  sandbox."

      keywords: "cloud computing, peer-to-peer computing, cluster computing, distributed computing"
      abstract: "Cloud computing is rapidly increasing in popularity. Companies
  such as RedHat, Microsoft, Amazon, Goog
  le, and
  IBM are increasingly funding cloud computing infrastructure
  and research, making it important for students to gain
  the necessary skills to work with cloud-based resources. This
  paper presents a free, educational research platform called
  Seattle that is community-driven, a common denominator
  for diverse platform types, and is broadly deployed.
  Seattle is community-driven - universities donate available
  compute resources on multi-user machines to the platform.
  These donations can come from systems with a wide
  variety of systems operating and architectures, removing the
  need for a dedicated infrastructure.
  Seattle is also surprisingly flexible and supports a variety
  of pedagogical uses because as a platform it represents a
  common denominator for cloud computing, grid computing,
  peer-to-peer networking, distributed systems, and networking.
  Seattle programs are portable. Students' code can run
  across different operating systems and architectures without
  change, while the Seattle programming language is expressive
  enough for experimentation at a fine-grained level. Our
  current deployment of Seattle consists of about one thousand
  computers that are distributed around the world. We
  invite the computer science education community to employ
  Seattle in their courses."
