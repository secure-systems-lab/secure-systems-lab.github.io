      authors:
        - name: "A.S.A. Yelgundhalli, P. Zielinski, R. Curtmola, J. Cappos"
      project: *gittuf
      booktitle: "Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2025 (NDSS 2025)"

      link: "/papers/yelgundhalli_gittuf_ndss_2025.pdf"
      abstract: "Git is the most popular version control system today, with Git forges such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket used to add functionality. Significantly, these forges are used to enforce security controls. However, due to the lack of an open protocol for ensuring a repository’s integrity, forges cannot prove themselves to be trustworthy, and have to carry the responsibility of being non-verifiable trusted third parties in modern software supply chains.

In this paper, we present gittuf, a system that decentralizes Git security and enables every user to contribute to collectively enforcing the repository’s security. First, gittuf enables distributing of policy declaration and management responsibilities among more parties such that no single user is trusted entirely or unilaterally. Second, gittuf decentralizes the tracking of repository activity, ensuring that a single entity cannot manipulate repository events. Third, gittuf decentralizes policy enforcement by enabling all developers to independently verify the policy, eliminating the single point of trust placed in the forge as the only arbiter for whether a change in the repository is authorized. Thus, gittuf can provide strong security guarantees in the event of a compromise of the centralized forge, the underlying infrastructure, or a subset of privileged developers trusted to set policy. gittuf also implements policy features that can protect against unauthorized changes to branches and tags (i.e., pushes) as well as files/folders (i.e., commits). Our analysis of gittuf shows that its properties and policy features provide protections against previously seen version control system attacks. In addition, our evaluation of gittuf shows it is viable even for large repositories with a high volume of activity such as those of Git and Kubernetes (less than 4% storage overhead and under 0.59s of time to verify each push).

Currently, gittuf is an OpenSSF sandbox project hosted by the Linux Foundation. gittuf is being used in projects hosted by the OpenSSF and the CNCF, and an enterprise pilot at Bloomberg is underway."

      abstract: "The widespread integration of open-source software into commercial codebases, government systems, and critical infrastructure presents significant security challenges, particularly due to the inclusion of vulnerable components. Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) are crucial for tracking these components; however, they lack detailed insights into the actual utilization of each component, thereby limiting their effectiveness in vulnerability management. This paper introduces CovSBOM, a novel tool that integrates code coverage analysis into SBOMs to provide enhanced transparency and facilitate precise vulnerability detection. CovSBOM addresses the gap between current SBOM and security scanning tools by providing detailed insights into which parts of third-party libraries are actually being used, thereby reducing inefficiencies and the misallocation of developer resources caused by overemphasizing irrelevant vulnerabilities. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 23 large-scale applications, encompassing 1,614 dependencies and 145 vulnerability alerts, CovSBOM has demonstrated a significant reduction in false positives, accurately identifying 105 such instances. This improvement enhances the precision of vulnerability detection by approximately 72%, while effectively maintaining a reasonable level of scalability and usability."

      abstract: "Software supply chain attacks are a major concern and need to be addressed by every organization, including automakers. While there are many effective technologies in both the software delivery and broader software supply chain security space, combining these technologies presents challenges specific to automotive applications. We explore the trust boundaries between the software supply chain and software delivery systems to determine where verification of software supply chain metadata should occur, how to establish a root of trust, and how supply chain policy can be distributed. Using this exploration, we design Scudo, a secure combination of software over the air and software supply chain security technologies. We show that adding full verification of software supply chain metadata on-vehicle is not only inefficient, but is also largely unnecessary for security with multiple points of repository-side verification.

In addition, this paper describes a secure instantiation of Scudo, which integrates Uptane, a state of the art software update security solution, and in-toto, a comprehensive supply chain security framework. A practical deployment has shown that Scudo provides robust software supply chain protections. The client side power and processing costs are negligible, with the updated metadata comprising 0.504% of the total update transmission. The client side verification adds 0.21 seconds to the total update flow. This demonstrates that Scudo is easy to deploy in ways that can efficiently and effectively catch software supply chain attacks."

      abstract: "Modern software installation tools often use packages from more than one repository, presenting a unique set of security challenges. Such a configuration increases the risk of repository compromise and introduces attacks like dependency confusion and repository fallback. In this paper, we offer the first exploration of attacks that specifically target multiple repository update systems, and propose a unique defensive strategy we call articulated trust. Articulated trust is a principle that allows software installation tools to specify trusted developers and repositories for each package. To implement articulated trust, we built Artemis, a framework that introduces several new security techniques, such as per-package prioritization of repositories, multi-role delegations, multiple-repository consensus, and key pinning. These techniques allow for a greater diversity of trust relationships while eliminating the security risk of single points of failure.
To evaluate Artemis, we examine attacks on software update systems from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s Catalog of Supply Chain Compromises, and find that the most secure configuration of Artemis can prevent all of them, compared to 14-59% for the best existing system. We also cite real-world deployments of Artemis that highlight its practicality. These include the JDF/Linux Foundation Uptane Standard that secures over-the-air updates for millions of automobiles, and TUF, which is used by many companies for secure software distribution."

      abstract: "Earlier work has proven that information extracted from recordings of an application’s activity can be tremendously valuable. However, given the many requests that pass between applications and external entities, it has been difficult to isolate the handful of patterns that indicate the potential for failure. In this paper, we propose a method that harnesses proven event processing techniques to find those problematic patterns. The key addi- tion is PORT, a new domain specific language which, when combined with its event stream recognition and transformation engine, enables users to extract patterns in system call recordings and other streams, and then rewrite input activity on the fly. The former task can spot activity that indicates a bug, while the latter produces a modified stream for use in more active testing. We evaluated PORT’s capabilities in several ways, starting with recreating the mutators and checkers utilized by an earlier work called SEA to modify and replay the results of system calls. Our re-implementations achieved the same efficacy using fewer lines of code. We also illustrated PORT’s extensibility by adding support for detecting malicious USB commands within recorded traffic."

A non-traditional approach can help students engage with the material and master these unfamiliar ideas. We have devised a series of lessons that teach important information security topics, such as social engineering, side-channel attacks, and attacks on randomness using card magic. Each lesson centers around a card trick that allows the instructor to simulate the described attack in a way that makes sense, even for those who have no prior technical background. In this paper, we describe our experience using these lessons to teach cybersecurity topics to high school students with limited computer science knowledge. Students were assessed be- fore and after the demonstration to gauge their mastery of the material, and, while we had a very limited set of responses, the results show an improvement on post-test scores.

Previous research focused on defining and quantifying this phenomenon, but not on explaining or critiquing it. In this work, we
address core omissions to the body of work on atoms of confusion,
focusing on the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of programmer misunderstanding.
We performed a think-aloud study in which we observed programmers, both professionals and students, as they hand-evaluated
confusing code. We performed a qualitative analysis of the data and
found several surprising results, which explain previous results,
outline avenues of further research, and suggest improvements of
the research methodology.
A notable observation is that correct hand-evaluations do not imply understanding, and incorrect evaluations not misunderstanding.
We believe this and other observations may be used to improve future studies and models of program comprehension. We argue that
thinking of confusion as an atomic construct may pose challenges to
formulating new candidates for atoms of confusion. Ultimately, we
question whether hand-evaluation correctness is, itself, a sufficient
instrument to study program comprehension."

Our goal was to see if particular patterns within the snippet induced higher levels of cognitive load, and if the collected EEG data might provide more detailed insights than performance measures. Our results suggest that while cognitive load can be an influence on code comprehension performance, other human factors, such as a tendency to forget certain programming rules or to misread what the code is asking them to do may also play a role, particularly for novice programmers. We conclude that: (1) different types of code patterns can affect programmers’ cognitive processes in disparate ways, (2) neither self-reported data nor brainwave activity alone is a reliable indicator of programmers’ level of comprehension for all types of code snippets, (3) EEG techniques could be useful to better understand the relationships between program comprehension, code patterns and cognitive processes, and (4) tests like ours could be useful to identify crucial learning gaps in novice programmers, which, in turn can be leveraged to improve programming tools and teaching strategies."

The latter group of features, which constitute the actual standard, make up the baseline layer for instructions, while all the elements required for interoperability are specified in a second layer, known as a Protocols, Operations, Usage, and Formats (POUF) document. We applied this technique in the development of a standard for Uptane, a security framework for over-the-air software updates used in many automobiles. This standard is a good candidate for a dual-layer specification because it requires communication between entities, but does not require a specific format for this communication. By deferring wire protocols and other implementation details to POUFs, the creators of the Uptane Standard were able to focus on the basic procedures and operations needed to secure automotive updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this format by specifying a POUF for the Uptane Reference Implementation."

      abstract: "Micropayments have a large number of potential applications. However, processing these small payments individually can be expensive, with transaction fees often exceeding the payment value itself. By aggregating the small transactions into a few larger ones, and using cryptocurrencies, today’s decentralized probabilistic micropayment schemes can reduce these fees. Unfortunately, existing solutions force micropayments to be issued sequentially, thus to support fast issuance rates a customer needs a large number of escrows, which bloats the blockchain. Moreover, these schemes incur a large computation and bandwidth overhead, limiting their applicability in large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose MicroCash, the first decentralized probabilistic framework that supports concurrent micropayments. MicroCash introduces a novel escrow setup that enables a customer to concurrently issue payment tickets at a fast rate using a single escrow. MicroCash is also cost effective because it allows for ticket exchange using only one round of communication, and it aggregates the micropayments using a non-interactive lottery protocol that requires only secure hashing and supports fixed winning rates. Our experiments show that MicroCash can process thousands of tickets per second, which is around 1.7-4.2x times the rate of a state-of-the-art sequential micropayment system. Moreover, MicroCash supports any ticket issue rate over any period using only one escrow, while the sequential scheme would need more than 1000 escrows per second to permit high rates. This enables our system to further reduce transaction fees and data on the blockchain by ∼ 50%."

      Many of these bugs can be traced to unexpected network, operating system, and file system differences
      that cause program executions that were successful in a development environment to fail once deployed.
      Preventing these bugs is difficult because it is impractical to test an application in every environment. Enter Simulating Environmental Anomalies (SEA), a technique that utilizes evidence of one application’s failure in a given environment to generate tests that can be applied to other applications, to see whether they suffer from analogous faults. In SEA, models of unusual properties extracted from interactions between an application, A, and its environment guide simulations of another application, B, running in the anomalous environment. This reveals faults B may experience in this environment without the expense of deployment. By accumulating these anomalies, applications can be tested against an increasing set of problematic conditions. We implemented a tool called CrashSimulator, which uses SEA, and evaluated it against Linux applications selected from coreutils
and the Debian popularity contest. Our tests found a total of 63 bugs in 31 applications with effects including hangs, crashes, data loss, and remote denial of service conditions."

      abstract: "Peer-assisted content distribution networks (CDNs) have emerged to improve performance and reduce deployment costs of traditional, infrastructure-based content delivery networks. This is done by employing peer-to-peer data transfers to supplement the resources of the network infrastructure. However, these hybrid systems are vulnerable to accounting attacks in which the peers, or caches, collude with clients in order to report that content was transferred when it was not. This is a particular issue in systems that incentivize cache participation, because malicious caches may collect rewards from the content publishers operating the CDN without doing any useful work. In this paper, we introduce CAPnet, the first technique that lets untrusted caches join a peer-assisted CDN while providing a bound on the effectiveness of accounting attacks. At its heart is a lightweight cache accountability puzzle that clients must solve before caches are given credit. This puzzle requires colocating the data a client has requested, so its solution confirms that the content has actually been retrieved. We analyze the security and overhead of our scheme in realistic scenarios. The results show that a modest client machine using a single core can solve puzzles at a rate sufficient to simultaneously watch dozens of 1080p videos. The technique is designed to be even more scalable on the server side. In our experiments, one core of a single low-end machine is able to generate puzzles for 4.26 Tbps of bandwidth, enabling 870,000 clients to concurrently view the same 1080p video. This demonstrates that our scheme can ensure cache accountability without degrading system productivity"

  call the causes of such misuse blindspots. In this paper, we study
  API blindspots from the developers’ perspective to: (1) determine
  the extent to which developers can detect API blindspots in code
  and (2) examine the extent to which developer characteristics (i.e.,
  perception of code correctness, familiarity with code, confidence,
  professional experience, cognitive function, and personality) affect
  this capability. We conducted a study with 109 developers from
  four countries solving programming puzzles that involve Java APIs
  known to contain blindspots. We find that (1) The presence of
  blindspots correlated negatively with the developers’ accuracy in
  answering implicit security questions and the developers’ ability to
  identify potential security concerns in the code. This effect was
  more pronounced for I/O-related APIs and for puzzles with higher
  cyclomatic complexity. (2) Higher cognitive functioning and more
  programming experience did not predict better ability to detect API
  blindspots. (3) Developers exhibiting greater openness as a personality
  trait were more likely to detect API blindspots. This study has
  the potential to advance API security in (1) design, implementation,
  and testing of new APIs; (2) addressing blindspots in legacy
  APIs; (3) development of novel methods for developer recruitment

      considerable misunderstanding in programmers. Until now, the real world
      impact of these patterns - known as 'atoms of confusion' - was only
      speculative. This work uses a corpus of 14 of the most popular and
      influential open source C and C++ projects to measure the prevalence and
      significance of these small confusing patterns. Our results show that the 15
      known types of confusing micro patterns occur millions of times in programs
      like the Linux kernel and GCC, appearing on average once every 23 lines. We
      show there is a strong correlation between these confusing patterns and
      bug-fix commits, as well as a tendency for confusing patterns to be
      commented. We also explore patterns at the project level showing the rate of
      security vulnerabilities is higher in projects with more atoms. Finally,
      we examine real code examples containing these atoms, including ones that
      were used to find and fix bugs in our corpus. In total, this work demonstrates
      that beyond simple misunderstanding in the lab setting, atoms of confusion
      are both prevalent - occurring often in real projects, and meaningful -
      being removed by bug-fix commits at an elevated rate."

      contains bugs that can be remotely exploited by attackers. When this
      software is on an electronic control unit (ECU) in a vehicle,
  exploitation of these bugs can have life or death
  consequences. Since software for vehicles is likely to
  proliferate and grow more complex in time, the number
  of exploitable vulnerabilities will increase. As a result,
  manufacturers are keenly aware of the need to quickly
  and efficiently deploy updates so that software vulnerabilities
  can be remedied as soon as possible.
  However, existing software-update security systems
  are not compromise resilient; if an attacker breaks into
  any portion of an automobile’s infrastructure, they could
  compromise numerous vehicles. The industry needs to
  dynamically choose updates for vehicles based on fresh
  information, forcing manufacturers to choose existing
  systems that sign updates using a key stored on the
  server. Attackers who compromise the repository can abuse this online key and cause malicious software to be
  installed on vehicles.
  In this article we discuss Uptane, the first, to our

      abstract: "A popular community repository such as Docker Hub, PyPI,
      or RubyGems distributes tens of thousands of soft- ware projects to
      millions of users. The large number of projects and users make these
      repositories attractive targets for exploitation. After a repository
      compromise, a malicious party can launch a number of attacks on
      unsuspecting users, including rollback attacks that revert projects to
      obsolete and vulnerable versions. Unfortunately, due to the rapid rate
      at which packages are updated, existing techniques that protect against
      rollback attacks would cause each user to download 2–3 times the size of an
      average package in metadata each month, making them impractical to deploy.

      In this work, we develop a system called Mercury that uses a novel technique
      to compactly disseminate version information while still protecting against
      rollback attacks. Due to a different technique for dealing with key
      revocation, users are protected from rollback attacks, even if the software
      repository is compromised. This technique is bandwidth-efficient,
      especially when delta compression is used to transmit only the
      differences between previous and current lists of version information.
      An analysis we performed for the Python community shows that once Mercury
      is deployed on PyPI, each user will only download metadata each month
      that is about 3.5% the size of an average package. Our work has been
      incorporated into the latest versions of TUF, which is being integrated by
      Haskell, OCaml, RubyGems, Python, and CoreOS, and is being used in

  have been done to measure performance over longer periods of time, while
  the subject does real-world activities. There are also few direct
  comparisons of a range of health indicators on different fitness tracking

  travelled data collected by three pairs of fitness trackers over a 14-day

  software updates consider standard attacks and deploy widely
  understood security mechanisms, such as digital signatures for the
  software updates, and hardware security modules (HSM) to sign
  software updates. However, no existing solution considers more
  advanced security objectives, such as resilience against a repository
  compromise, or freeze attacks to the vehicle's update mechanism,
  or a compromise at a supplier's site. Solutions developed
  for the PC world do not generalize to automobiles for two reasons:
  first, they do not solve problems that are unique to the automotive
  industry (e.g., that there are many different types of computers
  to be updated on a vehicle), and second, they do not address
  security attacks that can cause a vehicle to fail (e.g. a man-in-the-middle
  attack without compromising any signing key) or that can
  cause a vehicle to become unsafe. In this paper, we present Uptane,
  the first software update framework for automobiles that counters
  a comprehensive array of security attacks, and is resilient to partial

  omitting security patches, merging untested code into a

  We propose a defense scheme that mitigates these attacks

  taken, developers are given a shared history, so irregularities

  because a community repository must have immediate access to signing keys in order
  to certify the large number of new projects that are registered each day.

  This work demonstrates that community repositories can offer compromise-resilience
  and real-time project registration by employing mechanisms that disambiguate trust delegations.
  This is done through two delegation mechanisms that provide flexibility in the
  amount of trust assigned to different keys. Using this idea we implement Diplomat,
  a software update framework that supports security models with different security / usability tradeoffs.
  By leveraging Diplomat, a community repository can achieve near-perfect compromise-resilience
  while allowing real-time project registration. For example, when Diplomat is deployed
  and configured to maximize security on Python's community repository, less than 1%
  of users will be at risk even if an attacker controls the repository and is

      abstract: "Proposed is an extension to PEP 458 that adds support for end-to-end signing and the maximum security model. End-to-end signing allows both PyPI and developers to sign for the distributions that are downloaded by clients. The minimum security model proposed by PEP 458 supports continuous delivery of distributions (because they are signed by online keys), but that model does not protect distributions in the event that PyPI is compromised. In the minimum security model, attackers may sign for malicious distributions by compromising the signing keys stored on PyPI infrastructure. The maximum security model, described in this PEP, retains the benefits of PEP 458 (e.g., immediate availability of distributions that are uploaded to PyPI), but additionally ensures that end-users are not at risk of installing forged software if PyPI is compromised.

  This PEP discusses the changes made to PEP 458 but excludes its informational elements to primarily focus on the maximum security model. For example, an overview of The Update Framework or the basic mechanisms in PEP 458 are not covered here. The changes to PEP 458 include modifications to the snapshot process, key compromise analysis, auditing snapshots, and the steps that should be taken in the event of a PyPI compromise. The signing and key management process that PyPI MAY RECOMMEND is discussed but not strictly defined. How the release process should be implemented to manage keys and metadata is left to the implementors of the signing tools. That is, this PEP delineates the expected cryptographic key type and signature format included in metadata that MUST be uploaded by developers in order to support end-to-end verification of distributions."

  We demonstrate the power of our resource abstraction

      abstract: "Private Information Retrieval (PIR) allows users
  to retrieve information from a database without revealing
  which information in the database was queried. The traditional
  information-theoretic PIR schemes utilize multiple servers to
  download a single data block, thus incurring high communication
  overhead and high computation burdens. In this paper,
  we develop an information-theoretic multi-block PIR scheme
  that significantly reduces client communication and computation
  overheads by downloading multiple data blocks at a time. The
  design of k-safe binary matrices insures the information will not
  be revealed even if up to k servers collude. Our scheme has much
  lower overhead than classic PIR schemes. The implementation of
  fast XOR operations benefits both servers and clients in reducing
  coding and decoding time. Our work demonstrates that multiblock
  PIR scheme can be optimized to simultaneously achieve
  low communication and computation overhead, comparable to
  even non-PIR systems, while maintaining a high level of privacy."

      abstract: "Many APIs enable cross-platform system development
  by abstracting over the details of a platform, allowing
  application developers to write one implementation that will run
  on a wide variety of platforms. Unfortunately, subtle differences
  in the behavior of the underlying platforms make cross-platform
  behavior difficult to achieve. As a result, applications using these
  APIs can be plagued by bugs difficult to observe before deployment.
  These portability bugs can be particularly difficult to
  diagnose and fix because they arise from the API implementation,
  the operating system, or hardware, rather than application code.
  This paper describes CheckAPI, a technique for detecting
  violations of cross-platform portability. CheckAPI compares an
  application's interactions with the API implementation to its interactions
  with a partial specification-based API implementation,
  and does so efficiently enough to be used in real production
  systems and at runtime. CheckAPI finds latent errors that escape
  pre-release testing. This paper discusses the subtleties of different
  kinds of API calls and strategies for effectively producing the
  partial implementations. Validating CheckAPI on JavaScript,
  the Seattle project's Repy VM, and POSIX detects dozens of
  violations that are confirmed bugs in widely-used software."

One can draw a parallel between this model of thinking and techniques used in test-driven development, where students learn by thinking about how to effectively test their code and anticipate possible bugs. In this study, we analyzed the quality of both attack and defense code that students wrote for an assignment given in an introductory security class of 75 (both graduate and senior undergraduate levels) at NYU. We made several observations regarding students' behaviors and the quality of both their defensive and offensive code. We saw that student defensive programs (i.e., assignments) are highly unique and that their attack programs (i.e., test cases) are also relatively unique. In addition, we examined how student behaviors in writing defense programs correlated with their attack program's effectiveness. We found evidence that students who learn to write good defensive programs can write effective attack programs, but the converse is not true. While further exploration of causality is needed, our results indicate that a greater pedagogical emphasis on defensive security may benefit students more than one that emphasizes offense."

      abstract: "Mobile devices today, such as smartphones and tablets, have become both more complex and diverse. This paper presents a framework to evaluate the trustworthiness of the individual components in a mobile system, as well as the entire system. The major components are applications, devices and networks of devices. Given this diversity and multiple levels of a mobile system, we develop a hierarchical trust evaluation methodology, which enables the combination of trust metrics and allows us to verify the trust metric for each component based on the trust metrics for others. The paper first demonstrates this idea for individual applications and Android-based smartphones. The methodology involves two stages: initial trust evaluation and trust verification. In the first stage, an expert rule system is used to produce trust metrics at the lowest level of the hierarchy. In the second stage, the trust metrics are verified by comparing data from components and a trust evaluation is produced for the combined system. This paper presents the results of two empirical studies, in which this methodology is applied and tested. The first study involves monitoring resource utilization and evaluating trust based on resource consumption patterns. We measured battery voltage, CPU utilization and network communication for individual apps and detected anomalous behavior that could be indicative of malicious code. The second study involves verification of the trust evaluation by comparing the data from two different devices: the GPS location from an Android smartphone in an automobile and the data from an on-board diagnostics (OBD) sensor of the same vehicle."

In this work, we describe an open infrastructure that provides research communities with principled access to mobile devices and their sensors. Our platform, the Sensibility Testbed, is a free, community-driven platform for mobile devices. It provides secure data access to user-owned mobile devices while preserving user privacy. The unified programmable interface to sensors on heterogeneous devices in the Sensibility Testbed enables research scientists to design and deploy experiments that run across large numbers of devices, for example to measure the coverage and performance of cellular and WiFi networks. The Sensibility Testbed makes the sensing capabilities of smartphones more accessible to a broad range of researchers."

However, the sensors also pose privacy risks to users. This work describes BlurSense, a tool that provides secure and customizable access to all of the sensors on smartphones, tablets, and similar end user devices. The current access control to the smartphone resources, such as sensor data, is static and coarse-grained. BlurSense is a dynamic, fine-grained, flexible access control mechanism, acting as a line of defense that allows users to define and add privacy filters. As a result, the user can expose filtered sensor data to untrusted apps, and researchers can collect data in a way that safeguards users' privacy."

      abstract: "Smartphones serve as a technical interface to the outside world. These devices have embedded, on-board sensors (such as accelerometers, WiFi, and GPSes) that can provide valuable information for investigating users' needs and behavioral patterns. Similarly, computers that are embedded in vehicles are capable of collecting valuable sensor data that can be accessed by smartphones through the use of On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) sensors. This paper describes a prototype of a mobile computing platform that provides access to vehicles' sensors by using smartphones and tablets, without compromising these devices' security. Data such as speed, engine RPM, fuel consumption, GPS locations, etc. are collected from moving vehicles by using a WiFi On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) sensor, and then backhauled to a remote server for both real-time and offline analysis. We describe the design and implementation details of our platform, for which we developed a library for in-vehicle sensor access and created a non-relational database for scalable backend data storage. We propose that our data collection and visualization tools are useful for analyzing driving behaviors; we also discuss future applications, security, and privacy concerns specific to vehicular networks."

In this paper we instrument the Android OS to characterize background activities that prevent the device from sleeping. We present TAMER, an OS mechanism that interposes on events and signals that cause task wakeups, and allows for their detailed monitoring, filtering, and rate-limiting. We demonstrate how TAMER can help reduce battery drain in scenarios involving popular Android apps with background tasks. We also show how TAMER can mitigate the effects of well-known energy bugs while maintaining most of the apps' functionality. Finally, we elaborate on how developers and users can devise their own application-control policies for TAMER to maximize battery lifetime."

  home Internet bandwidth - the bandwidth required
  by end user applications at home. As building and
  managing last mile network infrastructure incurs substantial
  cost, the foresight of such trends is necessary to
  plan upgrades.
  Using a bottom-up approach, we look at four potentially
  disruptive technologies, including millimeter wave
  wireless (mm-wave), the Internet of Things (IoT), Fog
  Computing, and Software Defined Networking (SDN).
  We examine use cases proposed by academia and industry,
  delve into the bandwidth requirements for proposed
  applications, and use this data to forecast future traffic
  demands for typical home users. Our projections show
  that bandwidth changes at end user devices will most
  likely be driven by two of the above technologies: millimeter
  wave wireless and Fog Computing. These technologies
  not only change the peak bandwidth, but also
  have noticeable secondary effects on bandwidth such as
  increasing upload bandwidth use, improving flash crowd
  tolerance, and increasing off-peak demand. While IoT
  and SDN are important, innovative technologies, they
  will not drastically alter the bandwidth usage patterns of
  ordinary users at home. We hope that the data and recommendations
  from this study can help business leaders

  In this work we perform a large-scale analysis of Twitter to study the prevalence and behavior of Anonymous and Identifiable users. We employ Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to classify Twitter users as Highly Identifiable, Identifiable, Partially Anonymous, and Anonymous. We find that a significant fraction of accounts are Anonymous or Partially Anonymous, demonstrating the importance of Anonymity in Twitter. We then select several broad topic categories that are widely considered sensitive--including pornography, escort services, sexual orientation, religious and racial hatred, online drugs, and guns--and find that there is a correlation between content sensitivity and a user's choice to be anonymous. Finally, we find that Anonymous users are generally less inhibited to be active participants, as they tweet more, lurk less, follow more accounts, and are more willing to expose their activity to the general public. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to conduct a large-scale data-driven analysis of user anonymity in online social networks."

NetCheck relies on blackbox tracing mechanisms, such as strace, to automatically collect sequences of network system call invocations generated by the application hosts. NetCheck performs its diagnosis by (1) totally ordering the distributed set of input traces, and by (2) utilizing a network model to identify points in the totally ordered execution where the traces deviated from expected network semantics.

  Our evaluation demonstrates that NetCheck is able to diagnose failures in popular and complex applications without relying on any application- or network-specific information. For instance, NetCheck correctly identified the existence of NAT devices, simultaneous network disconnection/ reconnection, and platform portability issues. In a more targeted evaluation, NetCheck correctly detects over 95% of the network problems we found from bug trackers of projects like Python, Apache, and Ruby. When applied to traces of faults reproduced in a live network, NetCheck identified the primary cause of the fault in 90% of the cases. Additionally, NetCheck is efficient and can process a GB-long trace in about 2 minutes."

      abstract: "Over the years, we have witnessed various password-hash database breaches that have affected small and large companies, with a diversity of users and budgets. The industry standard, salted hashing (and even key stretching), has proven to be insufficient protection against attackers who now have access to clusters of GPU-powered password crackers. Although there are various proposals for better securing password storage, most do not offer the same adoption model (software-only, server-side) as salted hashing, which may impede adoption. In this paper, we present PolyPasswordHasher, a software-only, server-side password storage mechanism that requires minimal additional work for the server, but exponentially increases the attacker's effort. PolyPasswordHasher uses a threshold cryptosystem to interrelate stored password data so that passwords cannot be individually cracked. Our analysis shows that PolyPasswordHasher is memory and storage efficient, hard to crack, and easy to implement. In many realistic scenarios, cracking a PolyPasswordHasher-enabled database would be infeasible even for an adversary with millions of computers."

As a result, computer security necessarily involves thinking about the corner cases that arise when software executes. An unfortunate side effect of this is that computer security assignments typically necessitate deep understanding of a topic, such as how the stack is laid out in memory or how web applications interact with databases. This work presents a series of assignments that require very little background knowledge from students, yet provide them with the ability to reason about failures in programs. In this set of assignments, students implement two very simple programs in a high-level language (Python). Students first implement a reference monitor that tries to uphold a security property within a sandbox. For the second portion, the students are provided each others' reference monitors and then write attack code to try to bypass the reference monitors. By leveraging a Python-based sandbox, student code is isolated cleanly, which simplifies development and grading. These assignments have been used in about a dozen classes in a range of environments, including a research university, online classes, and a four year liberal arts school. Student and instructor feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Furthermore, survey results demonstrate that after a 2-3 week module, 76% of the students who did not understand reference monitors and access control learned these key security concepts."

      abstract: "Despite the security community's emphasis on the importance of building secure software, the number of new vulnerabilities found in our systems is increasing. In addition, vulnerabilities that have been studied for years are still commonly reported in vulnerability databases. This paper investigates a new hypothesis that software vulnerabilities are blind spots in developer's heuristic-based decision-making processes. Heuristics are simple computational models to solve problems without considering all the information available. They are an adaptive response to our short working memory because they require less cognitive effort. Our hypothesis is that as software vulnerabilities represent corner cases that exercise unusual information flows, they tend to be left out from the repertoire of heuristics used by developers during their programming tasks.

  To validate this hypothesis we conducted a study with 47 developers using psychological manipulation. In this study each developer worked for approximately one hour on six vulnerable programming scenarios. The sessions progressed from providing no information about the possibility of vulnerabilities, to priming developers about unexpected results, and explicitly mentioning the existence of vulnerabilities in the code. The results show that (i) security is not a priority in software development environments, (ii) security is not part of developer's mindset while coding, (iii) developers assume common cases for their code, (iv) security thinking requires cognitive effort, (v) security education helps, but developers can have difficulties correlating a particular learned vulnerability or security information with their current working task, and (vi) priming or explicitly cueing about vulnerabilities on-the-spot is a powerful mechanism to make developers aware about potential vulnerabilities."

      abstract: "The security community spares no effort in emphasizing security awareness and the importance of building secure software. However, the number of new vulnerabilities found in today's systems is still increasing. Furthermore, old and well-studied vulnerability types such as buffer overflows and SQL injections, are still repeatedly reported in vulnerability databases. Historically, the common response has been to blame the developers for their lack of security education. This paper discusses a new hypothesis to explain this problem by introducing a new security paradigm where software vulnerabilities are viewed as developers' blind spots in their decision making. We argue that such a flawed mental process is heuristic-based, where humans solve problems without considering all the information available, just like taking shortcuts. This paper's thesis is that security thinking tends to be left out by developers during their programming, as vulnerabilities usually exist in corner cases with unusual information flows. Leveraging this paradigm, this paper introduces a novel methodology for capturing and understanding security-related blind spots in Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Finally, it discusses how this methodology can be applied to the design and implementation of the next generation of automated diagnosis tools."

      abstract: "Application failures due to network issues are some of the most difficult to diagnose
  and debug. This is because the failure may be due to in-network state or
  state maintained by a remote end-host, both of which are invisible to an application
  host. For instance, data may be dropped due to MTU issues [18], NAT
  devices and firewalls introduce problems due to address changes and connection
  blocking [11], default IPv6 options can cause IPv4 applications to fail [3],
  and default buffer size settings can cause UDP datagrams to be dropped or
  truncated [37].
  This report presents the results of our work NetCheck [38]. In contrast
  with most prior approaches, NetCheck does not require application- or networkspecific
  knowledge to perform its diagnoses, and no modification to the application
  or the infrastructure is necessary. NetCheck treats an application as a
  blackbox and requires just a set of system call (syscall) invocation traces from
  the relevant end-hosts. These traces can be easily collected at runtime with standard
  blackbox tracing tools, such as strace. To perform its diagnosis, NetCheck
  derives a global ordering of the input syscalls by simulating the syscalls against
  a network model. The model is also used to identify those syscalls that deviate
  from expected network semantics. These deviations are then mapped to a
  diagnosis by using a set of heuristics."

In this work, we discuss one such testbed, Seattle. Seattle is an open research and educational testbed that utilizes computational resources provided by end users on their existing devices. Unlike most other platforms, resources are not dedicated to the platform which allows a greater degree of network diversity and realism at the cost of programmability. Seattle is designed to preserve user security and to minimally impact application performance. We describe the architectural design of Seattle, and summarize our experiences with Seattle over the past few years as both researchers and educators. We have found that Seattle is very easy to adopt due to cross-platform support, and is also surprisingly easy for students to use. While there are programmability limitations, it is possible to construct complex applications integrated with real devices, networks, and users with Seattle as a core component. From an educational standpoint, Seattle has been shown not only to be useful as a teaching tool, it has been successful in variety of different systems classes at a variety of different types of schools. In our experience, when low-level programmability is not the main requirement, Seattle can supersede many existing testbeds for diverse educational and research tasks"

      abstract: "This PEP proposes how the Python Package Index (PyPI [1]) should be integrated with The Update Framework [2] (TUF). TUF was designed to be a flexible security add-on to a software updater or package manager. The framework integrates best security practices such as separating role responsibilities, adopting the many-man rule for signing packages, keeping signing keys offline, and revocation of expired or compromised signing keys. For example, attackers would have to steal multiple signing keys stored independently to compromise a role responsible for specifying a repository's available files. Another role responsible for indicating the latest snapshot of the repository may have to be similarly compromised, and independent of the first compromised role.

  The proposed integration will allow modern package managers such as pip [3] to be more secure against various types of security attacks on PyPI and protect users from such attacks. Specifically, this PEP describes how PyPI processes should be adapted to generate and incorporate TUF metadata (i.e., the minimum security model). The minimum security model supports verification of PyPI distributions that are signed with keys stored on PyPI: distributions uploaded by developers are signed by PyPI, require no action from developers (other than uploading the distribution), and are immediately available for download. The minimum security model also minimizes PyPI administrative responsibilities by automating much of the signing process.

  This PEP does not prescribe how package managers such as pip should be adapted to install or update projects from PyPI with TUF metadata. Package managers interested in adopting TUF on the client side may consult TUF's library documentation [27], which exists for this purpose. Support for project distributions that are signed by developers (maximum security model) is also not discussed in this PEP, but is outlined in the appendix as a possible future extension and covered in detail in PEP 480 [26]. The PEP 480 extension focuses on the maximum security model, which requires more PyPI administrative work (none by clients), but it also proposes an easy-to-use key management solution for developers, how to interface with a potential future build farm on PyPI infrastructure, and discusses the feasibility of end-to-end signing."

  Using a bottom-up approach, we look at four potentially

  Computing, and Software Defined Networking (SDN).
  We examine use cases proposed by academia and industry,
  delve into the bandwidth requirements for proposed

  demands for typical home users. Our projections show
  that bandwidth changes at end user devices will most
  likely be driven by two of the above technologies: millimeter
  wave wireless and Fog Computing. These technologies
  not only change the peak bandwidth, but also
  have noticeable secondary effects on bandwidth such as
  increasing upload bandwidth use, improving flash crowd

  traditional mechanisms like virtualization and software fault

  compositions of virtual components are different than current

  models provides a new set of software engineering challenges

  understand how virtual component models can be evaluated,

  Such offline testing is only effective in scenarios
  where traces are expected to be reproducible (deterministic).
  Where reproducibility is not expected, for instance
  due to nondeterminism in the network environment, we
  must resort to on-the-fly testing, which does require a

  a major security threat to billions of devices worldwide. The
  standard libraries are hard to secure because they frequently
  need to perform low-level operations that are forbidden in
  untrusted application code. Existing designs have a single,
  large trusted computing base that contains security checks
  at the boundaries between trusted and untrusted code. Unfortunately,
  flaws in the standard library often allow an attacker
  to escape the security protections of the sandbox.
  In this work, we construct a Python-based sandbox that
  has a small, security-isolated kernel. Using a mechanism
  called a security layer, we migrate privileged functionality
  into memory-safe code on top of the sandbox kernel while retaining
  isolation. For example, significant portions of module
  import, file I/O, serialization, and network communication
  routines can be provided in security layers. By moving
  these routines out of the kernel, we prevent attackers from
  leveraging bugs in these routines to evade sandbox containment.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by
  studying past bugs in Java’s standard libraries and show
  that most of these bugs would likely be contained in our
  sandbox."

  the necessary skills to work with cloud-based resources. This
  paper presents a free, educational research platform called
  Seattle that is community-driven, a common denominator
  for diverse platform types, and is broadly deployed.
  Seattle is community-driven - universities donate available
  compute resources on multi-user machines to the platform.
  These donations can come from systems with a wide
  variety of systems operating and architectures, removing the
  need for a dedicated infrastructure.
  Seattle is also surprisingly flexible and supports a variety
  of pedagogical uses because as a platform it represents a
  common denominator for cloud computing, grid computing,
  peer-to-peer networking, distributed systems, and networking.
  Seattle programs are portable. Students' code can run
  across different operating systems and architectures without
  change, while the Seattle programming language is expressive
  enough for experimentation at a fine-grained level. Our
  current deployment of Seattle consists of about one thousand
  computers that are distributed around the world. We
  invite the computer science education community to employ
  Seattle in their courses."

        abstract: "Uptane is a secure software update framework for ground vehicles.
        This document describes procedures to enable programmers for OEMs and suppliers to
        securely design and implement this framework in a manner that better protects connected
        units on ground vehicles. Integrating Uptane as outlined in the sections that
        follow can reduce the ability of attackers to compromise critical systems.
        It also assures a faster and easier recovery process should a compromise occur."
